// Assertions the SHIPPED core stylesheet must satisfy — shared by the build
// (scripts/build-core-styles.mjs, which refuses to emit a bad file) and the
// standalone guard (scripts/check-core-css-compiled.mjs, which fails CI on one).
//
// The contract: dist/editor.css is fully compiled and namespaced. A raw
// `@tailwind` directive would be re-expanded by a HOST app's Tailwind against
// the host's config (collisions, wrong palette) and silently dropped in a host
// with no Tailwind at all (unstyled chrome). A selector that is not anchored to
// the editor reaches into host markup the editor does not own.
//
// STRUCTURAL, not a denylist. Naming the shapes we forbid only ever catches the
// leaks someone already thought of: `a { color }`, `:root { --doc-x }` and
// `.btn { padding }` all slipped past the four-pattern version of this check.
// The rule is inverted instead — every rule must be anchored — with a short,
// explicit allowlist for the engine's own namespaces.

 *
 * `.ProseMirror-` was here and is not ours at all — it is ProseMirror's, and
 * `.ProseMirror-yjs-cursor` is y-prosemirror's, so a host running its own
 * ProseMirror editor got our rules on its elements.
 *
 * `.layout-` we do mint, but the names are generic enough that a host could
 * mint them too (`.layout-paragraph`, `.layout-run-text`).
 * The old rationale — that they match painted document elements rather than
 * chrome, so the scope class "would be wrong" — does not hold: painted elements
 * are always inside the viewport, which always carries the scope class. They are
 * scoped now, which costs nothing and keeps the editor's CSS inside the editor.

 *      combinator already implies it (`.docx-run *::selection` ships as
 *      `.docx-run ::selection`)
 *
 * Write the readable form in an assertion. This function is what makes the
 * readable form match. Adding an assertion for a shape not folded here is the
 * one way to get a false "missing" against a correct file, so a new positive
 * assertion is a reason to re-check this list.
