'@eigenpal/docx-js-editor': patch
---

Agent now reads and searches the vanilla document. Previously, `read_document` showed insertions inlined and hid deletions (the resolved view), while the search backing `add_comment` / `suggest_change` flattened both — so a phrase the agent picked from `read_document` often failed to anchor and the bridge returned `null` with no diagnostic. Now both the read view and the search view treat the document as it exists right now: tracked insertions are hidden (not in the doc until accepted) and tracked deletions are visible as plain text (still in the doc until accepted). Anchoring against text the agent actually saw works on first try.
