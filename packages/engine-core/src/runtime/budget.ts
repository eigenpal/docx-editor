// Hierarchical resource budget tree (document-engine task 0.3 / design D9 / perf
// spec). Each operation owns a root budget; parsers, extensions, workers, layout,
// transport, and output carve child budgets from it. Reservations precede
// allocation and use overflow-safe counters. Every child budget, queue, spill
// file, and worker MUST release before its root budget — `dispose()` refuses
// while children or reservations are outstanding, and runs registered cleanups
// (spill files, worker termination) on the way out, LIFO, even if one throws.
