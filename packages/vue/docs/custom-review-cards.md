# Custom cards in the review rail

Render `DocxEditorReview` with `preset` set to `false` and put your card component inside it. The component reads items from `useReview()`, measures cards with `useReviewCardHeights()`, stacks them with `useStackedReviewPositions`, and converts positions to pixels with `useReviewRailMetrics()`.

## Render custom cards

The following example measures each card, stacks the cards, and shows a refused decision:

```vue
<!-- MyCards.vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
import {
  DocxEditorReview,
  useReview,
  useReviewCardHeights,
  useReviewRailMetrics,
  useStackedReviewPositions,
} from '@docx-editor.dev/pro/vue';

const { items, selectionAnchorY, accept, lastRefusal } = useReview();
const { metrics } = useReviewRailMetrics();
const { heights, cardRef } = useReviewCardHeights(items);
const positions = useStackedReviewPositions(items, heights, () => ({
  scale: metrics.value.scale,
  defaultHeight: 96,
}));
const top = (y: number) => `${metrics.value.top + y * metrics.value.scale}px`;
</script>

<template>
  <div
    v-for="item in items"
    :key="item.key"
    :ref="cardRef(item.key)"
    :style="{ position: 'absolute', top: top(positions.get(item.key) ?? 0) }"
  >
    {{ item.text }}
    <button v-if="item.kind === 'revision'" @click="accept(item)">Accept</button>
    <p v-if="lastRefusal?.key === item.key">{{ lastRefusal.code }}</p>
  </div>
  <DocxEditorReview.Draft :top="metrics.top + (selectionAnchorY ?? 0) * metrics.scale" />
</template>
```

```vue
<!-- MyRail.vue -->
<script setup lang="ts">
import { DocxEditorReview } from '@docx-editor.dev/pro/vue';
import MyCards from './MyCards.vue';
</script>

<template>
  <DocxEditorReview :preset="false">
    <MyCards />
    <DocxEditorReview.AddComment />
  </DocxEditorReview>
</template>
```

`accept` returns `false` when the editor refuses, and `lastRefusal` names the item and the diagnostic code. `DocxEditorReview` already announces each refusal in a live region, so show it in the card as plain text. For a translated sentence, call `useReviewRefusalMessage()`.

## Position cards and drafts

Convert a layout position to CSS pixels with `metrics.top + position * metrics.scale`.

| Input to `useStackedReviewPositions` | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `heights` | Measured card heights in CSS pixels, by item key, from `useReviewCardHeights(items)`. A card without a height reserves `defaultHeight`, and a taller card overlaps the next one until it is measured. |
| `scale` | `metrics.scale`, CSS pixels per layout point. |
| `defaultHeight` | The height to reserve before a card is measured. |

`DocxEditorReview.Draft` renders only while a comment draft is open. Without `top`, it takes the packaged stack's position, so pass `top` from your own stack. To keep the box clear of your cards, add an entry at `selectionAnchorY` to the list that you stack, in document order.

## Place review parts

`DocxEditorReview` finds its parts among its own children by element type. Fragments are transparent in React and Vue.

| Part | Placement |
| --- | --- |
| `List`, `Markers`, `AddComment`, `Balloon` | Direct children of `DocxEditorReview`. Inside your own wrapper, a part renders as plain content without its geometry. |
| `Draft` | A direct child, or inside your own card component. Inside a custom stack, pass `top` explicitly. |
| `Card`, `Empty`, and card parts such as `Author`, `Summary`, `Accept`, and `Reply` | Inside `DocxEditorReview.List`. |

With `preset` set to `false`, the rail adds no defaults, but recognized parts keep their wiring. Other children render inside the rail element.

## Limits

- `useReviewCardHeights()` observes each card in its own window, so it works in a pop-out window. It stops observing when the component unmounts, and drops the height of each item that leaves `items`. Pass the full item list, not only the cards on screen. In Vue, put `cardRef` on an element, or on a component with one root element that does not change.
- To hide a card, unmount it. A card hidden with `display: none` measures zero, so it keeps its last height and its space in the stack.
- If you measure cards yourself, compare each height with the last one you recorded outside component state, and write state only when it differs. In React, also pass a stable ref callback. A state write on every commit can cause a render loop.
- In the compact rail, `metrics.compact` is `true`. Place cards at `metrics.compactCardLeft`; `Draft` does this itself.
- Keep the column hidden while `metrics.left` is `null`.
