// Deliberately small. Its job is to prove the tree stack drives a real contenteditable in a
// browser — projection in, transactions out, committed through `TreeDocumentStore` — before
// any of it becomes the default path. It is NOT the paginated renderer and makes no layout
// claim; that is section 7.
//
// Every accepted transaction goes straight to `applyPmDoc`, so the canonical tree is the
// only state. When a transaction is refused the view is reconciled back to the committed
// projection rather than left showing an edit the model never took — a silent divergence
// between what the user sees and what will be saved is the one outcome worth avoiding.
