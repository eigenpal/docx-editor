 * character for character (that is what the plugin's needle search is), while consumer
 * bundlers match the emitted `new URL(<literal>, import.meta.url)` pattern syntactically —
 * output whitespace does not matter to them, only that the rewrite keeps the expression a
 * recognisable URL construction rather than folding it into something else.
 *
 * Exported for `subpath-tables.test.ts`, which asserts the installed glue still contains it
 * exactly once — so a harfbuzzjs bump that reshapes the glue fails in the TEST suite, not
 * only later in the build.
