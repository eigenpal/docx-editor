   * Returns `changed: false` on success, like every view-only call, because `changed` answers
   * for the document; to detect a settings change, compare the `snapshot().reviewPane`
   * reference, which changes only when a setting changes. Refused with `unsupported` when no review module is registered, and
   * with `invalidArgs` for an unknown field or value. A refusal changes nothing.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const result = editor.setReviewPaneOptions({ opening: 'manual', overflow: 'shrinkPage' });
   * if (!result.ok) console.warn(result.reason);
   * ```

   * Mount into `el`, which may belong to another document: a pop-out window opened with
   * `window.open`, or a same-origin iframe.
   *
   * A document that is already open MOVES into `el`, from another element or from a
   * previous `detach()`: the undo history, the selection, other editing state (such as an
   * armed format painter) and any collaboration session stay as they are. The reading
   * position is kept, and keyboard focus returns when the pages had it before (see
   * {@link AttachOptions.focus}). Focus, selection, pointer, scroll and resize listeners,
   * timers and registered font faces follow `el`'s window. Pending document bytes (an
   * instance created without a container, or a `load` while detached) mount now instead, as
   * a fresh session.
   *
   * The host copies the editor stylesheet and any web fonts it loads into `el`'s document.
   * Move the editor back, or `destroy()` it, before that window closes. An element whose
   * window has closed (or that has no window) is refused with an `invalidTarget` error and
   * the editor stays where it is. After `destroy()` this is a no-op that emits a typed
   * `error` event: a destroyed instance never remounts.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * // Pop the editor out into its own window and bring it back later.
   * const popup = window.open('', 'editor', 'width=900,height=1000')!;
   * copyStyles(document, popup.document); // host-owned: the editor CSS and fonts
   * const slot = popup.document.createElement('div');
   * popup.document.body.append(slot);
   * editor.attach(slot);
   * popup.addEventListener('pagehide', () => editor.attach(mainSlot), { once: true });
   * ```
