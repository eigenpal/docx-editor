// would put the caret into the per-block cache key and remeasure the document on every arrow
// press; resolving it in paint would rebuild spans just as often. Both are the wrong lane for a
// background colour.
//
// So layout marks which spans ARE fields (`data-field-atom`, painted once) and this toggles one
// class as the caret moves — the same division the open review item already uses. Cost is at
// most one query per caret move, against a document that never relayouts.
