 * The CHARACTER first. A user reaching for Ctrl+Alt+F presses the key that types `f`,
 * wherever their layout puts it, and Windows resolves accelerators the same way — so reading
 * the physical position first sent Dvorak's footnote chord to the key that types `u`.
 *
 * `event.code` is the fallback, for the case that makes `key` unreadable: a modifier that
 * COMPOSES. macOS turns Option+F into `ƒ`, Option+C into `ç` and Option+D into `∂`, none of
 * them a letter — so falling through to the keycap is the only way those chords work there,
 * and it costs nothing, because a `key` that IS a letter has already answered.
 *
 * Never both for one event: consulting `code` as well would claim a second chord wherever
 * the two disagree, which is every remapped layout.
 *
 * Shared with the adapters, whose Find shortcut reads letters the same way.
