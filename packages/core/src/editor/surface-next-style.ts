// Word's "style for following paragraph" (`w:next`), and the one gesture that reads it.
//
// Pressing Enter at the END of a paragraph starts a new one, and Word gives that new
// paragraph the style's `w:next` rather than the style the caret was in. That is why a
// heading is followed by body text: `Heading 1` declares `<w:next w:val="Normal"/>`.
// Without it, Enter after a heading produced a second heading, and every following
// paragraph inherited the heading's size, colour and outline level until the user reset
// the style by hand.
//
// The rule is about the CARET, not about the split: a split in the MIDDLE of a paragraph
// divides one paragraph into two of the same kind, so `w:next` does not apply there. Word
// draws the line the same way, which is why Enter at the start of a heading leaves an
// empty heading above rather than an empty body paragraph.
//
// Split out of `surface-structure.ts` for the reason `surface-list-style.ts` was: it is a
// style question, answered against `styles.xml` and the document's own default, rather
// than a structural edit at the selection.
