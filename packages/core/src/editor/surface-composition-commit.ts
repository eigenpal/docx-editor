// Composed text the page already shows commits on a later task, as batched typing does.
//
// An input method writes each finished syllable into the painted DOM before `compositionend`
// fires, so at that point the page already shows the text the readback commits. Committing it
// inside `compositionend` ran the transaction, the layout pass, the paint and every host
// listener's state read in that task, once per syllable. An input method that composes syllable
// by syllable (Hangul) also starts the next composition in the SAME task, so all of it landed
// between two compositions and delayed every key event in the frame.
//
// So a plain insertion is read back at `compositionend` and QUEUED: it commits on a zero-delay
// task, like a typed burst, or at the next flush point before anything else edits or reads the
// document. Each queued insertion is its own history entry, as each composition was. Until it
// commits, and until its paint lands, the page shows text the paint did not produce, and a
// composition that starts over it reads it with two texts:
//
//   - `read`, the text of the PAINTED layout. The page's spans publish offsets from that
//     layout, so the readback fills its gaps from it.
//   - `text`, what the page shows: the model's text with the queued insertions applied. The
//     next composed edit is the difference from it.
//
// Only an edit the page shows exactly takes this lane: one insertion at the caret, no change
// from anyone else since, no control or prompt landing. Anything else commits and paints at
// once. A queued insertion the store places elsewhere (past a tracked deletion it aimed into),
// or refuses, is caught when it lands, and the caller repaints from the model.
