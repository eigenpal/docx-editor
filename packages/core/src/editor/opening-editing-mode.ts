/**
 * How a document's opening editing mode is decided — pure decisions over the facade's
 * state, kept out of `docx-editor.ts` so the composition root stays under its line cap.
 *
 * Two callers, in order:
 *
 * 1. `resolveOpeningEditingMode` at CONSTRUCTION: an explicit `config.mode` is the
 *    host's standing choice for every open and wins over the document's own request.
 *    (`'view'` is handled where `editingMode` is initialized; it needs no decision here.)
 * 2. `documentTrackingAdoption` at each MOUNT, once the document's settings are
 *    readable. `w:trackRevisions` ASKS for suggesting: it is a property of the file, not
 *    of the reader, so a package that carries it opens in suggesting — otherwise the
 *    first keystroke is an untracked edit in a document whose author asked for the
 *    opposite, with the pill reading "Editing". An enforced
 *    `w:documentProtection w:edit="trackedChanges"` REQUIRES it: that protection makes
 *    `setEditingMode('editing')` refuse `locked`, so it outranks even an explicit
 *    `mode: 'edit'` — opening in editing there would put the editor in a mode its own
 *    gate refuses to enter.
 *
 * Suggesting has preconditions either way: writing `w:ins`/`w:del` is the review
 * module's capability, and a proposal needs an author to be attributed to. With no
 * module the document opens and edits normally — the edits are simply untracked,
 * exactly as `can(setEditingMode: 'suggesting')` reports. With a module but no author,
 * the editor opens editing and the REASON is published (`rejection`) rather than the
 * request being dropped in silence.
 *
 * The same two preconditions gate the RUNTIME request, `setEditingMode('suggesting')`,
 * through `suggestingModeRefusal`. Entering suggesting without an author used to succeed
 * and then refuse every keystroke: the pill read Suggesting, the document took focus, and
 * typing changed nothing. A missing author is a host configuration error, so the request
 * is refused with the reason, and `createSuggestingConfigurationReporter` raises it once
 * through the editor's error channel for the host that never reads the result.
