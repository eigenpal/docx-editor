/**
 * Keeps the local selection where the user put it while other people edit.
 *
 * A remote commit changes text the local caret is addressed into by offset. Without this,
 * text a peer inserted before the caret left the caret at its old offset, so the next
 * keystroke landed inside the peer's words, and a peer's deletion could leave the offset
 * past the end, where every keystroke was refused. Yjs editors solve this with relative
 * positions; this engine addresses text by paragraph id and offset, so it carries the
 * selection across the before and after text of the paragraphs it touches, which gives
 * the same answer for every change a peer can make to that text.
 *
 * The before text comes from the layout that is still on screen when the remote commit
 * arrives, and the mapping runs when the next layout is published, so a burst of remote
 * commits costs one mapping and no extra layout pass.
