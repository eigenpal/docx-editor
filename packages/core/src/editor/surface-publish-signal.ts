// Which surface publishes are worth telling a host about (editor seam).
//
// The surface reports on every commit, every caret move and every chrome toggle, and most of
// those tell a host nothing new. The facade's two signals are `change` (a document revision
// moved) and `selectionChange` (everything else observable), and the second one has no
// revision to compare — so it compares KEYS, one per piece of observable state that moves
// without moving the caret.
//
// It lives in its own file because the list only ever grows: every feature that keeps state
// on the surface rather than in the document — the armed typing format, the open furniture
// story, how a drawing came to be selected, the format painter's arming — has to be added
// here or its chrome sleeps through it. Kept beside the facade, that list was five
// interleaved `let`s reset from three places, and the omission had no obvious home.
