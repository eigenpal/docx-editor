/**
 * One side of `w:spacing`, as the attributes a space-before/after write states.
 *
 * `undefined` states nothing: the side a call does not name keeps whatever the paragraph
 * authored. `null` REMOVES the attribute, so the value inherits from the style again —
 * which is not the same as a zero, and a zero is what Word's "Remove space before" writes.
 *
 * The two attributes beside the measurement go with it, because each SUPERSEDES it
 * (§17.3.1.33): `w:beforeAutospacing` substitutes Word's own gap, and `w:beforeLines`
 * measures in hundredths of a line instead of twips. A merging write that left either in
 * place wrote a number the file then ignored.
 *
 * They are cleared differently, because their off values differ. `w:beforeAutospacing="0"`
 * is a real off, so it is written explicitly and blocks an inherited flag. `w:beforeLines`
 * has no off value — `"0"` there means zero lines of space, which would supersede the twips
 * beside it — so the attribute is dropped instead.
