//
// Once the input method has written, the painted DOM is its own until `compositionend`, so
// the surface holds its repaint for that long (see `render` in paginated-surface.ts). The
// MODEL does not wait: a collaborator's edit arriving mid-composition is applied at once. At
// `compositionend` the page therefore shows the paragraph as it was when the hold began,
// plus what the input method wrote, while the model holds that older text plus the
// collaborator's edit. Diffing the two would read the collaborator's edit as the user's, and
// undo it.
//
// So the readback is taken against the text the page shows (`base`), and the one edit that
// yields is moved onto the model's current text. Offsets move the way a remote caret's do
// (`mapOffsetAcrossText`), so the composed text stays where the reader's caret is. A
// deletion the composition made (a candidate replacing a selection) never deletes what a
// collaborator wrote, which the user did not see.
