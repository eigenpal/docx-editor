// Where a write LANDS, and WHAT it writes there.
//
// Two questions, because they fail differently and one hides the other.
//
// Where it lands catches the damage: a write aimed at the body while the reader is in a header
// edits content the user cannot see, and a write refused because the gate validated the wrong
// part looks like nothing happened. Asserting on the SAVED PACKAGE rather than a return value
// is deliberate, since a cross-story write reports success and only the bytes disagree.
//
// What it writes catches the subtler half. Increase Indent on a list item DEMOTES it in the
// body (`w:ilvl` 0 to 1, and a level declared in `numbering.xml`) and merely SHIFTS the
// paragraph everywhere else (a bare `w:ind`). Both land in the right part, so a part-identity
// assertion calls that parity when it is two different commands behind one button.
