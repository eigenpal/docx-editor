// The story-parity rule: what an operation may do differently depending on which story the
// caret is in.
//
// A DOCX holds several independent stories: the body, each header and footer part, and the
// footnote and endnote parts. Two specs already require that editing behaves the same in all
// of them:
//
//   - `scoped-header-footer-editing/specs/header-footer-editing/spec.md`: a command enabled in
//     an open header scope "SHALL apply to that story with the same semantics it would have on
//     equivalent body content".
//   - `typed-notes-footnotes-endnotes/specs/notes-authoring-surface/spec.md`: typing, formatting
//     and undo "SHALL behave as in the body", and the toolbar reflects the formatting there.
//
// Nothing enforced that, so the engine drifted: reads indexed the body while writes stayed
// scoped, and the two disagreed. This file is the machine-readable rule. Its tests check the
// engine against it by running the same operation on an identical paragraph in every story.
//
// `SLOT_PARITY` is a `Record<ChromeSlotId, ...>`, so a slot added to `CHROME_GROUPS` without a
// declared rule has no rule to satisfy. That is caught by the `every chrome slot declares a
// rule` test, NOT by the compiler: `packages/core/tsconfig.json` excludes every `__tests__`
// directory, so nothing here is typechecked. If that exclusion is ever lifted, the `Record`
// annotation starts failing the build too, which is strictly better — but do not rely on it
// today, and do not repeat the claim that it already happens.
