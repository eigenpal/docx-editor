// A content control resolves in the story the caret is in, and its verbs write there.
//
// The sharpest test in the contract, because the defect it was written for is the only one
// that edited content the user could not see. `contentControlAtCaret` resolved the control
// from the caret's x/y against `layout.contentControls`, which holds BODY records only. A
// header caret's coordinates land in the top band of the body content box, so a body control
// won the hit test, and `setValue` and `remove` rewrote and deleted body content while the
// reader was editing a header.
//
// The assertions are structural rather than behavioural: node ids are part-qualified, so "did
// this resolve in the right story" is a question about the id's prefix, and that holds however
// the resolver is later rewritten.
