// `snapshot().selection` round-trips through `exec({type:'setSelection'})`, in every story.
//
// The contract promises exactly that, and the promise became reachable for furniture the moment
// the paraId index spanned every story. It was not kept: the index widened and its two readers
// did not follow. `resolveDocAnchor` read the paragraph's text out of the BODY part, got `''`,
// and returned `ok` with a zero-length span — so the caret landed on a paragraph the open scope
// had never heard of, and every keystroke after it was dropped with no refusal at all.
//
// A silently-dropped edit is worse than a refused one, so this asserts the whole loop: address,
// re-select, and then TYPE — because only typing proves the caret and the scope agree.
