// `zoom-fit.ts` has the arithmetic and `zoom-controller.ts` the measuring; this is the part
// that owns the state and answers the contract.
//
// ONE APPLY PATH is the load-bearing rule here. A fit and a toolbar click are
// indistinguishable downstream — both rescale the surface, both bump the tick, both emit — so
// a host that listens rather than polls sees an automatic refit exactly as it sees a click. An
// earlier shape that only wrote the variable on a refit left every such host showing the old
// percentage.
