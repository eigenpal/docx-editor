// The history group of the command being executed, for the surface's write path.
//
// `Editor.exec` takes `historyGroup` as an option, and the surface verb it dispatches to
// (`setRunProperty`, `setParagraphProperty`, ...) commits through `applyOps` several calls
// down without an options parameter of its own. Threading one through every formatting
// verb would touch each of them for a value none of them interprets, so the facade binds
// the group for the synchronous span of the command instead, and the surface's commit
// path reads it.
//
// Bound to ONE owner — the surface whose command it is — and TAKEN by that owner's first
// commit, which clears it. Two things follow. Another editor instance written to from
// inside the span (a change listener that mirrors an edit elsewhere) reads nothing, so a
// gesture token never crosses editors. And host code that runs after the command's own
// write, inside the same span (`onChange`, `onTrackedChange`, a store subscriber), finds
// the group already taken, so its writes are their own undo steps. Bound exactly, not
// inherited: a nested `exec` without a group runs ungrouped, and the type-buffer flush
// runs with the group cleared, because buffered keystrokes that land at the head of a
// grouped command are an edit of their own, not a frame of the gesture.

 * `around` takes the bound group for `owner` and holds it for the span of `run` — the
 * surface's `commitNow` body — then restores whatever was held before. Restored, not
 * cleared: a listener that writes back through a surface verb during the commit re-enters
 * `around`, and the outer command's later writes must keep their group. Taken AFTER the
 * type-buffer flush has run inside the same commit, which is safe because the flush binds
 * `undefined` for its own span and so finds nothing to take. A commit that LANDS nothing —
 * a verb reporting a refusal before its real write — hands the group back, so the write
 * that follows in the same command still carries it.
