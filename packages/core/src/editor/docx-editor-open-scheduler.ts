// The open-yield scheduler: one painted frame between "open this document" and the
// blocking mount, so a host's loading screen can actually show.
//
// Opening a document parses, lays out and paints in one synchronous pass — seconds of
// blocked main thread on a long file — and a mount that runs in the same task as
// `load()`/`attach()` blocks the very frame that would have painted the host's loading
// screen. Documents past {@link OPEN_PAINT_YIELD_CONTENT_BYTES} of CONTENT therefore
// schedule the mount behind one painted frame, and `snapshot().isOpening` is true for
// exactly that window. Small documents keep the synchronous path: they need no loading
// flash, and every existing synchronous caller stays as it was. So does every
// environment without `requestAnimationFrame` — headless and server hosts mount
// synchronously by definition.

/**
 * The UNCOMPRESSED size past which an open earns a painted loading frame first.
 *
 * Mount cost tracks the content, and the zipped size lies about it: a 200-page
 * tracked-changes document is ~1.6 MB of XML but zips under 90 KiB, while WordprocessingML
 * routinely compresses 10–20×. So the threshold reads the true entry sizes from the ZIP
 * central directory (see {@link zipContentExceeds} — a bounded scan, no decompression).
 * Documents under this mount well inside a frame or two on current hardware; over it,
 * the synchronous mount visibly freezes the page the document was opened from.

 * count is a bounded uint16, the walk advances monotonically and bounds-checks every
 * read, the sizes are only summed and compared — never fed to an allocation — and the
 * sum exits early at the limit, so a forged huge size simply means "defer", which the
 * real parser then judges. Anything malformed answers `false` and the open proceeds on
