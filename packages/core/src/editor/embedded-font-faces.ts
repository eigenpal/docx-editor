// Paint-side twin of embedded-font auto-wiring, done safely (issue #78).
//
// Measurement never touches the browser's font machinery: HarfBuzz shapes the admitted
// bytes directly. But painted pages are ordinary DOM, so a font that exists only inside
// the DOCX renders in a platform substitute unless the SAME bytes are registered as a
// `FontFace`.
//
// The naive version of that — register under the family the DOCUMENT declares — is a
// zero-click UI-redressing hole, and was reverted once already. `FontFaceSet` is
// per-DOCUMENT, not per-subtree: a face added for a family name hides the installed font
// of that name for the WHOLE page. A file fully controls `w:font/@w:name`, so a document
// naming its face `Segoe UI` would repaint the host application's own chrome with
// attacker-chosen glyphs. CSS-quoting the name stops CSS injection, not shadowing —
// quoting is not namespacing.
//
// So faces register under an ENGINE-MINTED alias derived from the admitted face's content
// hash, and the painter emits `font-family: "<alias>", "<declared family>"`. Document text
// gets the embedded glyphs; the declared name keeps whatever it means to the host page.
