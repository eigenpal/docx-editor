// Shared by both adapters: the toolbar's collapse POLICY, so React and Vue cannot drift on
// what collapses first.
//
// THE BAR IS ONE ROW. Wrapping to a second and third row was the old answer, and on a
// laptop beside an open navigation pane it ate a third of the window before a single line
// of the document was visible. So the row measures itself and moves controls into an
// overflow menu instead. The fit itself, one control at a time, is `toolbar-item-fit.ts`.
//
// TWO RULES DECIDE WHAT GOES:
//
// - GROUP BY GROUP. The fit empties one group, from its end, before it touches the next,
//   and a group that empties takes its separator with it, so no separator stands between
//   nothing and something.
// - A DECLARED ORDER, not "whatever is last". Registry order is bar order, and its tail is
//   the review controls: the comments toggle and the editing-mode pill, which stay at every
//   width. The order below is the collapse policy of THIS arrangement, which is the same
//   layer that merges the four alignment slots into one dropdown; the registry stays free
//   of layout policy.

/**
 * Collapse order: the first id here is the first group to leave the bar.
 *
 * Zoom goes first (a document you cannot format is worse than one you cannot scale), then
 * the small standalone groups, then the paragraph controls, and text formatting and history
 * last. A group the registry has but this list does not is collapsed before all of these,
 * in reverse bar order — a host-added group has no declared standing, and the alternative
 * is a new group that silently never collapses.
