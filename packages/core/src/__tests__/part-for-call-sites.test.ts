// `partFor` call sites are pinned, because a partFor read is a write in disguise.
//
// `partFor(partName)` opens a story store and PERMANENTLY retains its slot — the store
// caps editable story parts (`DEFAULT_MAX_EDITABLE_STORY_PARTS`, 64), and a slot once
// opened is never returned. `editor/surface-scope.ts` documents the failure in full:
// sixty-four such "reads" and no further header, footer or note could be opened for the
// rest of the session, silently. A pure read routes through `partOfNodeId`
// (`editor/surface-scope.ts`) or another store read API instead.
//
// So every `partFor(` in non-test source is pinned here — across every package that can
// reach a session, not just core — in the manner of `prosemirror-isolation.test.ts`. Add
// a new site only for a WRITE that needs the open store, then update this list; a removed
// site fails too, so the list ratchets down. Occurrences count comment MENTIONS as well
// as calls, deliberately: the census stays a dumb grep so it cannot be argued with.
