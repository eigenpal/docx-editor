// What a browser import actually pulls in (task 10.1).
//
// The lane DAG says the editor lane may not import the server lane. That is a rule about
// DECLARED dependencies, and a bundler does not read it — it follows `import` statements,
// through re-export barrels, into whatever they reach. A single `export *` in a barrel is
// enough to put a transport stack and a Yjs document in every consumer's bundle while every
// package.json still looks correct.
//
// So this walks the real import graph from the browser entry points and asserts what it can
// reach. It resolves relative imports within a package and package imports across the
// workspace, which is what a bundler does; it stops at third-party names and records them,
// which is enough to catch the dependencies that matter here.
