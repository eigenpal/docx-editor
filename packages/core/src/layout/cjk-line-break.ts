// Line-break opportunities: Latin word boundaries and CJK ideographic breaking
// (UAX #14, minimal ideographic form).
//
// Latin scripts break at spaces, dashes and tabs — `wordBoundaries` below. CJK prose
// carries no spaces at all: a Chinese clause was one giant "word", wrapped only through
// the wider-than-empty-line chop, and any run or piece seam inside it became the only
// place a line could end (#526). UAX #14 gives ideographic characters (class ID) a break
// opportunity on BOTH sides instead, subject to the kinsoku prohibitions: a line must not
// START with a closing character (。，、」…) and must not END with an opening one (「（…).
//
// These helpers retain the inexpensive Latin fallback and conservative ideographic
// character tables. Production East Asian flow uses cjk-paragraph-breaks.ts: one
// paragraph-wide analysis protects graphemes and numeric groups across every run seam,
// handles mixed-script boundaries, and consumes the OOXML language/settings policy.
// cjk-spacing.ts owns compression and hanging punctuation; cjk-justify.ts distributes
// line slack as published geometry. Layout-owned field results remain atomic.
