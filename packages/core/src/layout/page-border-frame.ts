// LAYOUT OWNS THE BAND, paint owns the ink — the same division `columnSeparators` draws and
// the same one the paragraph rules already state (`semantic-paint.ts`, "the paint NEVER
// recomputes thicknesses"). Two reasons it has to be this way round for a page border:
//
//  - `w:offsetFrom="text"` measures `w:space` from the TEXT, so the distance from the sheet
//    edge is `margin - space - stroke`. Paint holds a page box and a scale; it does not hold
//    `w:pgMar`, and handing it the margins so it could subtract them would be handing it the
//    job of deciding where the border is.
//  - Compound styles (`double`, …) publish an INFLATED band, because Word's `w:sz` for those
//    is the total extent and a thin authored double still has to paint as two lines. That
//    inflation is `borderStrokeWidthPt`, shared with paragraph and table borders.
//
// Boxes leave here PAGE-BOX RELATIVE (origin = the sheet's own top-left), which is what keeps
// a reused sheet cheap: `remapPage` slides a page down the document stack and the frame rides
// along untouched.

 * `space` outside the text edge and its outer face a further `stroke` out — `margin - space -
 * stroke`. Clamped at zero: an authored space wider than the margin would put the frame off
 * the paper, where Word instead pins it to the sheet edge.
 *
 * A side with no rule still has a frame edge, because the two rules that meet it have to stop
 * somewhere. It gets the same formula with nothing of its own to contribute (`space` and
 * `stroke` both zero), which lands the corner on the text edge in `text` mode and on the sheet
 * edge in `page` mode. Word's own dialog keeps all four spacings equal even for sides that are
 * switched off, so the common three-sided frame is unaffected either way.

 * The four rules close a rectangle rather than each spanning its own side. Word draws one box,
