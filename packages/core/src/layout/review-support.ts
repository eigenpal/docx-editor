// walking revisions, stitching comment anchors, threading replies — is the pro review module's
// implementation and lives in `@docx-editor.dev/pro`. The review-item VOCABULARY — the typed
// item shapes, stable keys and position resolution — lives in the store lane
// (`store/store/review-items.ts`), where the binding lane can reach it too; this module
// re-exports it so `@docx-editor.dev/core/layout` keeps publishing the whole review surface,
// and adds only what needs layout records: anchor indexes and card geometry.
