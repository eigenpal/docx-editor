// Toggle properties of the style hierarchy (ECMA-376 §17.7.3).
//
// A toggle property is the one class of run property that does NOT resolve by last-wins.
// §17.7.3 gives the shape of the rule:
//
//   "If the value specified by the document defaults is true, the effective value is true.
//   Otherwise, the values are combined by a Boolean XOR as follows:
//   value_effective = val_table XOR val_paragraph XOR val_character."
//
// and it resolves ONE level through its `basedOn` chain, not one value per style:
//
//   "If multiple instances of the toggle property appear at the same level of the style
//   hierarchy, then the first value encountered by the following algorithm shall be used ...
//   Attempt to read the value in the style. If it does not exist and the style has a basedOn
//   element with a non-empty value, repeat step 1 using the style specified by the basedOn
//   element."
//
// So three values enter the combination, and a whole `basedOn` chain contributes one of them.
// Combining a chain by parity instead is what made an ordinary Word edit — re-tick bold on a
// style whose base is already bold — come back unbold.
//
// A LEVEL IS TRI-STATE: on, off, or absent.
//
//   absent  falls through; the level is not part of the combination at all
//   on      REVERSES the state the weaker levels resolved to (this is the XOR)
//   off     SETS the state off, and clears the document defaults' short circuit with it
//
// THE MODEL IS A HYBRID, and the two halves rest on different evidence. Say which is which
// before changing either.
//
//   `on`, and the document defaults' short circuit, are SPEC-LITERAL. Both sentences quoted
//   above are followed exactly. LibreOffice does NOT implement the short circuit — it renders
//   `docDefaults <w:b/>` + a character style `<w:b/>` as regular, where this resolves bold —
//   and the behaviour has not been checked against Word. Those two cases follow the spec and
//   nothing else.
//
//   `off` has NO spec support. §17.7.3 introduces the per-level algorithm with the aside
//   "(if no value is encountered, the property takes on its default value)" — false, per
//   §17.3.2.1 — and `false XOR x` is `x`, so read literally an explicit `w:val="0"` at a
//   level is a no-op. It is not treated as one here,
//   because every implementation says otherwise: LibreOffice renders `docDefaults <w:b/>` +
//   character `<w:b w:val="0"/>` as regular, this engine did the same before the cascade
//   existed, and Word's own authoring corroborates the split — a "Not Bold" character style
//   over a bold paragraph style is spelled `<w:b/>`, because the toggle is how you cancel,
//   which leaves `w:val="0"` for an explicit off.
//
// Direct formatting is absolute: "If a toggle property is explicitly set in direct formatting
// applied to a given piece of content, then its value in the direct formatting shall be
// used." Callers either append direct `w:rPr` after the combined result, where
// `resolveRunStyle`'s last-wins reading makes it absolute, or pass it as a `direct` level.
