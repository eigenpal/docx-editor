 *   new value, so the consumer keeps reading the pre-edit state.
 * - `covered` — another hashed field ALREADY moves whenever this one moves, so hashing it
 *   again buys nothing. Only a field with that proof gets this role.
 *
 * The maps below are `satisfies Record<keyof …>`, so a new field on a record is a TYPE ERROR
 * here until somebody classifies it. That guard is the point: `props`, `indent`, `borders`
 * and `lines.drawings` were each added to a record, missed here, and shipped as a stale-read
 * bug that only a hand-written test could catch.
