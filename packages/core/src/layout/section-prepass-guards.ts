// What keeps each field of a REUSED section prepass current.
//
// The prepass memo (`semantic-layout.ts`, `const prepassValid =`) reuses the whole record
// verbatim while every input it derives from is unchanged. The validity expression is
// hand-written: a field added to `SectionPrepass` and to `buildSectionPrepass`'s return but
// to no `prepassValid` clause typechecks — and is then served stale across every change
// that moved it. This is the widest silent-staleness surface the memo chain has, which is
// why it gets the `PAGE_REUSE_GUARDS` treatment: the set, written down and type-checked,
// with a companion test asserting the source expression agrees with the map.
