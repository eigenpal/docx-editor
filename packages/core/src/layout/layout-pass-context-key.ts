 * Builds the context key for a pass. The notes reserve part is a parameter because the pass
 * computes it twice: once up front, and once more at the end against the pages it produced.
 *
 * Body line ids are paragraph-local, so a changed line count in an earlier section does not
 * invalidate this section. Geometry and flow start still do. The document page index is
 * deliberately NOT here — numbers re-project at finalize and shells renumber at remap; keying
 * on it re-laid every section below an Enter that added one page. The one real dependence,
 * page PARITY, is checked by `comparable` through the session parity fields.
 *
 * The producer is compared BESIDE the context (`session.producer`), not embedded in it: it
 * carries the control token, which runs to kilobytes on a control-heavy document, and
 * embedding it copied that token into every section's context string on every pass.
