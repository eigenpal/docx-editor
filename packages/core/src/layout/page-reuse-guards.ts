// What keeps each field of a REUSED page current.
//
// A page is reused whole. Convergence appends `previous.pages.slice(...)` and the unchanged
// exit returns the previous pages by identity, so nothing compares a page field by field the
// way `fragmentSignature` compares a fragment. Every field is guarded somewhere else instead,
// and each of those guards is hand-written and lives in a different file.
//
// This is that set, written down and type-checked. A new field on `PageRecord` is a type
// error here until somebody says which mechanism keeps it current, because the failure it
// would otherwise ship is silent: a reused page showing a value the document no longer has.

 * differs from its neighbours, page parity over an odd delta (even/odd headers,
 * inside/outside anchors), per-page-index note reserves, or per-page-index wrap exclusion
 * zones.
 *
 * INDEX 0 is special for two reasons — a `w:titlePg` variant, and a continued sheet whose
 * content box comes from the section before it — and the test has two halves either way. A
 * positive delta must not carry page 0 along inside the tail (`markPageCount > 0` proves the
 * tail starts after it). A negative delta must not land the tail ON index 0 either:
 * `delta + markPageCount` is the number of pages completed before the join, and at zero the
 * tail's first sheet becomes page 0, keeping a header record and a content box that page 0
 * does not resolve to.
 *
 * The `continuedInsets` half is defence in depth rather than a fix for an observed failure.
 * Reaching it needs both flows parked on an EMPTY page at the join — `sameFragments` compares
 * content signatures that include each paragraph's unique id, so two different pages can only
 * agree by being empty — which for a continued section means `flowStartY === 0`, a state the
 * flow does not appear to produce (every `flushPage` is followed by placing the block that
 * forced it, and a section ended by a page break reports `endsOpenPage === false`, which
 * refuses continuation outright). It is stated here anyway, because index 0 IS now different
 * and a guard that depends on an unrelated condition holding is not a guard.
