// `w:tblOverlap w:val="never"` (ECMA-376 Part 1 §17.4.56): floating tables that may not overlap.
//
// The property only constrains floating tables against each other. Paragraph text wraps
// around such a table like around any other floating table.
//
// A text-anchored floating table that would cover an earlier floating table on its page moves
// when either of the two refuses overlap. The later table moves, never the earlier one:
//
// - First to the right, so that its wrap band (grid plus `w:leftFromText` and the like) touches
//   the earlier table's band, when its grid then still fits between the margins.
// - Since mode 15, then to the left in the same way (`floatingTableOverlapMovesLeft`).
// - Otherwise down, so that its band starts where the earlier band ends. It keeps its
//   horizontal position, and the next collision is resolved the same way.
//
// Known limits: page- and margin-anchored tables keep their authored position, floats that an
// earlier section left on a shared sheet are not obstacles here, and a page with more than
// `MAX_NO_OVERLAP_OBSTACLES` refusing obstacles keeps every table where it was authored.
