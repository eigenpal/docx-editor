/**
 * Digest of one vector shape's geometry and chrome, for the layout reuse token.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a serialization. `JSON.stringify` of a shape at the 1024-point budget is
 * ~48 KB and ~230 us, and `isCompatibleWith` reads this token twice per atom whenever the
 * atom-identity fast path misses, so the serialization dominated a document full of shapes.
 * Every other field in the enclosing token is a cheap scalar join; this one folds the point
 * stream into two 32-bit FNV-1a accumulators and joins the scalars verbatim. The shape of
 * the component list (its length, and each subpath's length) is joined literally rather than
 * hashed, so a structural change can never hide inside the digest.
 *
 * This is a cache key, NOT a security primitive. FNV-1a is trivially invertible — its round
 * is `h = (h ^ d) * p` with an odd, hence modularly invertible, `p` — so a chosen last
 * coordinate can drive both accumulators to any target in closed form. That buys nothing
 * here, because forging a collision needs two shapes under the same `drawingNodeId` in two
 * revisions of one document, and the payoff is a stale repaint. Do not reuse this digest
 * anywhere an attacker profits from a collision.
