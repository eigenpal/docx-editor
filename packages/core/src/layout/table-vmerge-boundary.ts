// A two-row vertical merge (17.4.85 `w:vMerge`) whose page break falls right after its head row.
//
// A merge that does not fit the page from its head's top is declined by
// `table-vmerge-heights.ts`, and its head then sizes its own row: the row grows to the page
// bottom, places what fits of the merged text, and continues the rest on the next page ABOVE
// the row the merge continues into. In compatibility mode 15 and later, a merged text that
// cannot place a single line inside the head row's own height is laid out differently:
//
// - the head row keeps only its own cells and its own height on the first page;
// - the whole merged text starts in the continuation row on the next page, beside that row's
//   own cells, with its space before.
//
// "Cannot place a single line" includes the cell's widow and orphan rules: a paragraph whose
// first line alone fits the head row moves whole, as it does at any page break. The head row
// does not grow for the merged text even when the page has room below it.
//
// The rule is deliberately narrow. It applies only when every merge headed in the row ends in
// the next row, the next row starts no merge of its own, the next row cannot start on this
// page below the head row, and each merged head either fits the head row whole or places
// nothing there. A merged text that splits inside the head row, a merge over three or more
// rows, an exact-height row, a row at the page top, an earlier compatibility mode, and
// bottom-to-top text all keep the older path.
//
// The merged text stays the head cell's text on every page. The next row is placed with the
// head cell in its continuation's grid slot, so the text breaks as the head breaks it, and the
// row grows or splits to hold it. The head's margins, borders and fill paint it; its vertical
// alignment is the continuation cell's, the cell it is painted beside. Each fragment of that
// row is then published below a zero-height continuation of the head row
// (`publishCarriedMergedText`): the head cell's copy there holds the text and spans the row
// beside it, as any merge whose head continues onto a later page does, and the continuation
// cell stays an inert continuation (`table-carried-head-row.ts`). Every reader of
// cell records (selection, table commands, hit testing, Markdown, paint) then finds the text
// under the head cell and the head row, in document order.
