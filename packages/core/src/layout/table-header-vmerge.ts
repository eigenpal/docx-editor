// Vertical merges inside the leading `w:tblHeader` rows (17.4.49, 17.4.85 `w:vMerge`).
//
// The header rows are placed as ONE group: measured together, moved whole, and repeated on
// every continuation page. A merge that starts and ends inside that group used to be sized by
// its head row alone, so the head row took the whole merged height and every other header row
// was added below it. The group is now planned by the same planner the body rows use
// (`table-vmerge-heights.ts`), at the y the group is about to be placed at, and the SAME plan
// gives both the height the paginator admits and the options each row is placed with.
//
// Three rules keep that plan safe inside a group that has no continuation page:
//
// - a merge whose chain goes on into the first body row is never planned here. Its head keeps
//   sizing its own header row, which is the shape the body rows and a repeated copy expect;
// - the group is atomic, so a merge is taken whatever the page bottom: the group moves or
//   degrades as a whole, and the planned height is never taller than the unplanned one;
// - a detached head that a side-effect-free placement at its real y shows owing a remainder
//   is withdrawn from the plan before anything is published (the one-pass rollback of
//   `layoutOnePassRow`). The check runs again just before the row is committed, because a row
//   placed above it may have published a wrap band since the group was measured.
//
// A group with no such merge keeps its row-by-row measurement exactly.
