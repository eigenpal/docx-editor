// Which parts a boundary pass collects controls from, and their merged index.
//
// A control lives in the part that DECLARES it, and a header is a different part from the
// body. The pass used to derive boundaries from the body part alone, so a control in a header
// was never collected: it had no geometry, and its outline could neither draw nor hit-test.
//
// Extracted from `content-control-boundary-layout.ts` to keep it under the line cap. Pure
// functions over parts and layouts, with no page geometry.

/**
 * The body's part, then each distinct HEADER and FOOTER part the layout draws.
 *
 * A control lives in the part that declares it, and a header is a different part from the
 * body. Deriving boundaries from the body alone meant a control in a header was never
 * collected — so it had no geometry, and its outline could neither draw nor hit-test.
 *
 * Deduplicated by part IDENTITY, because one header part is shared across every page it
 * appears on and across sections that inherit it.
 *
 * Not the note parts. A note's fragments hang off the page's note areas rather than off a page
 * story, so this pass has no origin to place their controls with. Collecting them would publish
 * boundaries the painter and the hit test cannot use.
 *
 * The table lane draws that line in two places, on purpose. `semantic-cell-selection.ts` covers
 * notes as well, because a cell selection is resolved by id and its geometry is shifted per
 * story. The HOVER walks — `semantic-table-interaction.ts` and `table-interaction-targets.ts` —
 * stop at header and footer, matching this pass. A table in a footnote is editable through the
 * editor commands and offers no row or column handles.
