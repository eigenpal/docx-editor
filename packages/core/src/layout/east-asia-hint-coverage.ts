// A `w:hint="eastAsia"` character the East Asian face has no glyph for.

// The hint sends punctuation and symbols such as U+2011, quotes, and dashes to the East Asian
// face. When that face has no glyph for the character (SimSun, Microsoft YaHei, MingLiU, Malgun
// Gothic, and Batang have no U+2011), the character is drawn by a fallback face with the advance
// of the Latin face, and the East Asian face sets neither its width nor the line height. The
// run language does not change this. Projection resolves font slots before any face is known,
// so this pass runs where a measurer is: it hands such characters back to the Latin slot.
