 * page when the row splits there, or `null` when the row cannot continue below that line.
 *
 * The head reaches the first legal cut at or below `lineBottom` in the referencing cell, and at
 * least the first legal cut of every other cell, because a split row opens every cell. The row
 * continues only when some cell holds content below that point. `null` as well for a row that
 * places whole (`w:cantSplit`, an exact height) and has not split already, and for a row with
 * a rotated cell. Cells that merge vertically across rows are skipped: their content belongs to
 * the merge, which the paginator carries across a page break.
