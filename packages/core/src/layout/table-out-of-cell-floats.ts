//
// Printed from Word 16.113 in mode 14: such an object wraps like a BODY float. It stays where
// it resolves from the table's original, unpushed layout, and every row whose band touches
// or crosses the object's band moves below it, with the rows after it. It does not matter
// whether the row overlaps the object horizontally. `wrapNone`, in-front and behind objects
// push nothing. The object does not move with the rows it pushed.
//
// Only the cases this module can place exactly take part: a top-level cell paragraph whose
// every anchor is such a float, in a table with no vertical merges and a top-aligned cell.
// Everything else keeps the cell flow's own handling (see `anchoredOutOfCell`).
