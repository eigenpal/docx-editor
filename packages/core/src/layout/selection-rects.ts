 * today. Widening the walk to the other stories is not enough on its own: header and footer
 * fragments carry positions relative to their own story box, note fragments relative to their
 * note area, and one header story object is attached to EVERY page it applies to. Fed straight
 * into a page-content-relative rect, those produce a band per page, at coordinates belonging
 * to a different box. Measured, that put a header comment's band on all six pages of a
 * document at the top-left of the body text. Painting nothing is wrong; painting over the
