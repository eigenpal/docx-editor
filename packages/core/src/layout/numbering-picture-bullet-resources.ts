// Image resolution for `w:numPicBullet` markers, on the ordinary embedded-image path.
//
// `w:numPicBullet` lives in `numbering.xml` and its `v:imagedata/@r:id` names a relationship
// of THAT part, so it resolves through the numbering part's own rels and not the story's.
// Everything else is the path an inline picture takes: `resolveEmbedded` refuses an external
// target without fetching it, refuses a target that escapes the package, sniffs the
// signature, validates the header, applies the decode caps, and only then mints a validated
// handle. Every refusal is a STATE, not a throw, so the marker falls back to the level's
// `w:lvlText` instead of failing the document.
