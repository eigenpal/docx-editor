/**
 * The note-reserve slice of one section's layout context key.
 *
 * The reserve map is keyed by DOCUMENT page index (`computeFootnoteReserves`), while a
 * section's pass reads it at `pageIndexStart + localSlot` as it opens pages. The key folds
 * exactly the entries that pass can read — document slots in
 * `[pageIndexStart, pageIndexStart + pageBound)` — so a reserve on another section's pages
 * cannot invalidate this one. `pageBound` is EXCLUSIVE and section-LOCAL: the highest local
 * page slot the pass can read, plus one.
 *
 * Entries are emitted at their LOCAL slot (`documentSlot - pageIndexStart`), not the document
 * one. The document page index is deliberately absent from a section's context key (an Enter
 * that adds a page above must not re-lay every section below), and the local slot is what the
 * pass's reads actually depend on: two passes whose readable windows carry the same heights
 * at the same local offsets read identically wherever the section sits, so a section whose
 * reserves shift down a sheet with it reconverges to its stored key once the reflow loop has
 * recomputed the map, while a reserve that stays at a fixed document page as the section
 * moves lands on a different local slot and invalidates.
 *
 * Entries are sorted by slot so two content-equal maps render one canonical key regardless
 * of insertion order. `Infinity` folds every entry from `pageIndexStart` on (a pass with no
 * prior page count cannot bound its reads). A window with no entries keys like no map at
 * all: both mean every read returns zero, and two encodings of that would invalidate every
 * untouched section when a document's last note disappears.
