// A text-anchored positioned table that row pagination places in the body flow.
//
// Where a table comes from. A `w:tblpPr` table with `w:vertAnchor="text"` (and no
// `w:tblpYSpec`) normally waits for its anchor paragraph and is placed there whole
// (`admitsAtAnchor` in `table-float-exclusion.ts`). Row pagination places it instead when:
// - its rows do not fit the room below the body cursor but its opening does (below), in a
//   single-column section, without `w:topFromText` or a negative `w:tblpY`, and without
//   `w:doNotBreakWrappedTables`. `w:bottomFromText` alone never keeps it whole;
// - it is taller than a page, earlier wrapping pictures or frames reach its cells, or a header
//   or footer holds wrapping objects. These routes skip the keep-whole conditions above.
//
// How it breaks:
// - The opening is the header rows and the first line of every cell of the first body row, or
//   that row's minimum height when larger, or the whole row when its height is exact.
// - The first fragment keeps the `w:tblpY` offset below the body cursor. When the opening fits
//   only a fresh page below content already in the column, or a negative offset would break the
//   table below that content, the table moves there first and keeps its offset, as a whole table
//   moves with its anchor (`openTextTable`). A negative offset at a page top reaches into the
//   top margin, as an unbroken positioned table does.
// - Rows paginate as in an unpositioned table: a row splits between lines at the page bottom
//   and moves to the next page only when the room left cannot hold its minimum height or the
//   first line of every cell. The first body row is the opening's and never moves alone.
//   `w:cantSplit` is ignored, as for page-positioned tables. Later fragments open at the top of
//   the next page or column, below repeated header rows.
//
// The text after it:
// - The anchor paragraph and what follows continue on the page of the last fragment. Beside a
//   table that leaves no passage wider than a quarter inch in its column, no text fits, so they
//   resume below the last row and its `w:bottomFromText` (`resumeAfterBreak`). Beside a
//   narrower table they resume at the top of that fragment, which then wraps text like any
//   floating table: the paginator publishes it with `wrapsFollowingText`, and
//   `addFloatingTableExclusions` turns it into a zone. Text that starts there sits at the top of
//   the page, so its space before collapses. A page- or margin-positioned table that breaks
//   (`table-pinned-break.ts`) resumes the text by the same rule.
// - An earlier floating table that waits for the same anchor paragraph is placed where the body
//   reached this table (`noteAnchor` in `semantic-layout.ts`), even when the table then moves on.
//
// A table that does not break resumes the text below its last row, as before. Limit: a first
// body row whose minimum fits neither the room left nor a fresh page splits where it stands.
