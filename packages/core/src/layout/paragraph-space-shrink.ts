 * shrink must pass the rule's cost test against the stretch of the line without the word. A

 * reach their limit before the mark fits, as long as they fit the text before the mark and
 * the rule hangs marks. Its mark then hangs.
 *
 * A word that straddles a source-run seam (a quoted bold term, a semicolon left in the next
 * run) overflows on a later piece than the one that opened it. The kept line still runs to
 * `lineWidth`, but the line without the word ends where the word began, so `wordStart` and
 * `wordStartWidth` describe that alternative. Their defaults are the values the caller
 * already holds when the overflowing candidate opens the word.
 *
 * `wordEnds` says the next character is a space, in this run or at the start of the next one,
 * or that only hanging spaces remain in the paragraph. A candidate without its own space is
 * then a complete word: a space in its own run, or one split off by East Asian break rules,
 * hangs at the line end exactly as a space inside the candidate would, and the paragraph's
 * last word borrows space as any other word does. `followingWidth` measures the remainder of
