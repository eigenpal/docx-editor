// Row heights for a table whose cells merge vertically (17.4.85 `w:vMerge`).
//
// A merged cell covers several rows, so Word sizes the MERGE, not the row that starts it:
// the span gets `max(sum of the spanned rows' own heights, the merged content's height)`.
// Sizing the first row to the whole merged content instead pushes every later row of the
// span down by the full content height — the rows fall off the page and the column beside
// the merge paints as one band of the first row's fill.
//
// The surplus — merged content taller than the rows it covers — goes to the LAST row of the
// span, not evenly across the span. A reference rendering of a four-row merge settles that:
// every row but the last painted at exactly its `w:trHeight` minimum and the last one painted
// 6pt over its minimum, which is the whole surplus. An even split would have moved the
// second and third band edges as well, and the reference left them where the minimums put
// them. A last row with `w:trHeight hRule="exact"` cannot grow (17.18.37), and the surplus
// does NOT move up to an earlier row: every row keeps the height its own cells give it, and
// the merged content is clipped at the span bottom. Reference renderings of two- and
// three-row merges over an exact last row show exactly that.
//
// A span is decided ONE AT A TIME, by the caller, against the page it will really land on:
//
// - `heightOf` says what the span needs, with every span accepted before it folded in;
// - `accept` takes it into the plan — its head is DETACHED from its own row, so the row is
//   sized by the cells that really belong to it, and its rows take height floors;
// - a merge NOT accepted stays exactly where it was before this module existed: its head
//   sizes its own row, and the ordinary row-split machinery paginates it.
//
// The plan binds NOTHING a later row can contradict. It sets a floor under a row's height
// and takes a head's content out of its row's height; every number it hands out is a HEIGHT,
// turned into a position by whoever is placing, so nothing here goes stale when a row moves.
//
// A merged head is measured WHERE IT WILL SIT. `measureRowHeight` is otherwise position-free
// and drops wrap bands on purpose, which under-measures a head a floating drawing makes
// wrap; the span is then too short for its own content, and every way that ends — painting
// past the rows, clipping the tail, splitting a row that cannot split — is a defect. So the
// admission probe runs at the head row's real top with the bands in place. Getting the
// measurement right is the fix; the fallout is not something to choose between.
//
// Two things then keep the content inside the cell:
//
//   1. a detached head stops at the page content box AND at its own span. Both are bounds a
//      cell can hand back a remainder against, so neither swallows the line it stops: the
//      row splits and the next fragment carries the rest, the way any cell does;
//   2. every row of an accepted span lands in the same fragment as its head — the span was
//      admitted only because it fits the page from the head's top, and a covered row may not
//      break a page BEFORE placing something into it.
//
// Nothing here DISCARDS content to stay inside a box. Losing a word is worse than the
// overflow this module exists to stop, so where a bound bites, what it stops is carried.
//
// (2) holds at five break sites, for three different reasons:
//
//   whole-row move        an OPTIMIZATION — the row would sit here — so it is refused for a
//                         covered row, which is the only guard this design needs;
//   `remaining <= 0`      the page is already full, so the fragment reaches the bottom and
//                         so does the furthest (1) let the content go. Safe, allowed;
//   split continuation    the same, after placing to the page bottom. Safe, allowed;
//   `w:cantSplit` unfit   a RECOVERY: refusing it aborts the whole table instead;
//   nothing fitted        a RECOVERY, likewise.
//
// The two recoveries can still end a fragment above content the head already flowed, which
// paints merged text below its table. They stay allowed, because aborting a document is
// worse, and because the accurate admission probe is what stops them being reachable in the
// first place. `float-over-table-harness.ts` is where that claim gets tested.
//
// Declining one merge does not decline its neighbours. When a joint decision (below) does not
// fit the page, its head sizes its own row and every merge headed under it is offered again
// at its own head row, as a decision of its own.
//
// Merges that start in the same row AND end in the same row are ONE decision. They cover the
// same rows, so the plan detaches all of their heads together, measures those rows with none
// of them, and reserves the tallest head. Deciding them one at a time kept every head after
// the first sizing the head row, and the rows below then carried that height a second time.
//
// A span with other merge heads below its head row is decided JOINTLY with them. The
// decision takes every merge headed in a row it covers, and a merge that ends after the span
// (a staircase: it starts inside the span and ends below it) extends the decision to its own
// end row, where more merges can join in turn. One walk goes top to bottom over every row of
// the decision, with all of its heads detached. When the walk reaches a merge's last row,
// that row grows to what the merge still needs below its rows above, so every merge sees the
// surplus an earlier one put in its rows. Reference renderings of two- and three-step
// staircases place each row exactly so: the first merge grows the row the two share, and the
// second merge only adds what that grown row does not give it. The whole decision is one
// admission (it fits the page from the first head, or none of it is taken), one commit, and
// one withdrawal.
//
// Three shapes are declined outright, each from data that cannot change during placement:
//
// - a joint decision with a head row whose merges end in different rows, or with more than
//   `MAX_JOINT_MERGE_GROUPS` head rows. Those heads size their own rows, and a row whose
//   height the decision cannot predict is a row the paginator may move;
// - a joint decision where a merge headed under the first one was already decided alone;
// - a merge starting in a row that already has a plan for a span ending ELSEWHERE. Detaching
//   it empties the head row of what the earlier plan measured there, so the row collapses and
//   that span's rows stop adding up to the height it was sized at — its content then paints
//   below the table. One span length per head row is planned; the rest size their own row.
//
// A span every row of which is `hRule="exact"` and too short for the merged content is
// accepted like any other: its rows keep their fixed heights, and its head flows through
// the whole span and is clipped at the bottom of the last row (`clippedSpanCellIds`). It
// never hands back a remainder, because no row of the span can take more.
//
// Those rules together mean accepted spans that overlap at all were decided TOGETHER: two
// decisions cover disjoint rows, and inside one decision every span may share rows with any
// other. A surplus lands in another span's rows only inside one decision, and the walk
// already counts it: each span's bound is derived from the final floors when its head row
// is placed, so a surplus that a later span adds to a shared row only makes it taller. The
// decision's rows are all held to the fragment of its first head, so a span that runs past
// the first head's own span still lands whole with it. Anything that lets two decisions share
// a row has to add a guard for that.
//
// Measurement is not repeated work: a row inside an accepted span is probed here instead of
// by the paginator, so only the merge head itself costs one extra probe.
//
// The leading `w:tblHeader` rows are planned as their own row list, once for each place the
// group is laid out (`table-header-vmerge.ts`). A merge that runs from a header row into the
// body rows is planned by neither list, so its head keeps sizing its own row.
