// Answers about a resolved table row, shared by the row's side-rule copies.
//
// Width-dependent side-rule geometry is written onto copies (`legacy-table-side-rules.ts`). A
// copy only adds or drops `centeredSideRules` and `centeredSidePaint` on some cells. It shares
// everything else with its source by reference: the row's own fields, and each cell's fields,
// `blocks` included. An answer that reads none of those flags holds for every copy, so the
// whole family keeps one record: an answer found for one copy is found for all of them.
//
// The record holds only primitive answers, never a row, so a copy does not keep its source
// alive. Any other row copy, such as a text edit or a split override, starts its own record.
