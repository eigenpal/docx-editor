// Word's paragraph-level pagination controls: widow/orphan, keep-with-next, keep-lines.
//
// These decide WHERE a paragraph is allowed to cross a page boundary, not how it measures.
// `semantic-layout.ts` owns the flow cursor and calls in here for the decision, so the rule
// itself stays a pure function of line counts and can be reasoned about (and tested) without
// a page, a measurer or a DOM.
//
// All three are style-inheritable, so they are read from the CASCADED paragraph property bag
// (`docDefaults` → `basedOn` chain → style → direct), the same bag `w:pageBreakBefore` and
// `w:spacing` are read from. Reading direct `w:pPr` alone would miss every heading that gets
// its `w:keepNext` from the `Heading 1` style — which is all of them.
//
// Everything here fails OPEN. A keep rule that cannot be honoured places the content anyway,
// because Word does the same: a paragraph taller than a page still prints, and a keep chain
// that cannot fit is abandoned rather than looped over.
//
// Modern-mode table paragraphs also use widow/orphan control when a row crosses pages. The
// table placer decides the cut before publishing lines; exact-height rows still clip.
// Cross-paragraph keep chains remain body-flow decisions, while row atomicity is owned
// by `w:cantSplit`. A body keep-next chain ends at a table, priced by the table's opening
// (`tableKeepOpening` in `table-row-keeps.ts`) when the caller supplies one.

 * behaviour without the rule (the keep does not fire); over-estimating would move content to
 * a page it never needed to be on, which is a visible fidelity regression.

 * `sumAdjacentSpacing` adds each member's before-spacing to the after-spacing above it rather
 * than collapsing the two, for documents with `w:doNotUseHTMLParagraphAutoSpacing`. `carry`
 * is then already zero, because the flow cursor carries no collapsible after-spacing.
 *
 * `room` is the flow height left for the group, in the same units as the result. A kept
 * member that cannot fit whole in it and may split under its own rules breaks naturally:
 * its last line then opens the next page with its successor, so the keep holds without
 * moving it. The group ends there at the member's shortest legal opening. A member that
 * fits whole still needs its successor's opening beside it, so the chain continues.
 * A member with an authored page or column break keeps the whole opening before the break.

 * every interior boundary carries the `between` rule instead of a top and a bottom. So a
 * paragraph's own bottom edge — which rule is drawn, how much vertical extent it claims, and
 * whether it publishes a `bottomBorder` record at all — is a function of the block AFTER it.
 *
 * Nothing about that reaches the block's content key, so the incremental pass resumed past a
 * paragraph that had just stopped being the last of its group and kept the closing edge it no
 * longer owned. The extent is real height, so the error compounds down the flow: a
 * three-paragraph group edited on its last member laid out over three pages where the same
 * bytes reopened took two.
 *
 * Both bits go in, not only the forward one. Incremental RESUME is a prefix cut, where a
 * backward dependency is safe because the earlier block moving re-places everything after it.
 * The convergence tail is a SUFFIX cut, where backward is the exposed direction: a block can
 * sit inside the common suffix while the paragraph above it joins or leaves its group.
 *
 * No repro is known for that, and the reason is worth writing down: the tail's guard compares
 * fragment SIGNATURES, and `semantic-fragment-signature.ts` hashes every `w:pBdr` stroke, so
 * even a height-neutral group change (a different `w:color` on the same `w:sz`) moves the
 * signature of the paragraph that changed. `above` is folded anyway. That guard only sees a
 * changed paragraph still pending on the page being built, it is not the guard that owns this
 * question, and the bit is free — one string comparison the fold already has in hand.
 *
 * `groupKeyAt` answers `''` for a block that can never group: a table, or a paragraph with no
 * borders at all. Two paragraphs group only when their keys are EQUAL, which is what makes an
 * indent change split a group — the key carries the box geometry as well as the rules.

/**
 * Flow keys that also carry each block's TOC FIELD verdict.
 *
 * A TOC is a complex field spanning paragraphs: a begin paragraph holding `fldChar begin` and
 * the `TOC` instruction, cached result paragraphs, an end paragraph. Layout answers three
 * questions per paragraph from that shape — suppress the field chrome, keep one placeholder
 * line on the begin paragraph because the TOC resolved to nothing, suppress a blank cached
 * result row — and each answer is read from the OTHER paragraphs of the same field.
 *
 * The begin paragraph is the sharp case: whether it keeps a placeholder line depends on
 * whether any RESULT paragraph after it still carries visible text. Refreshing a TOC that
 * comes back empty rewrites the result paragraphs and leaves the begin paragraph untouched,
 * so resume started at the first result and reused a begin paragraph that had just gone from
 * "emits nothing" to "emits a placeholder line" — the line simply vanished for the life of
 * the session, and reopening the same bytes brought it back.
 *
 * The three raw membership bits go in rather than the two booleans layout derives from them,
 * so the fold stays correct whatever the derivation grows into. `verdictAt` answers `''` for
 * a block no TOC touches, which is every block of a document that has no TOC.

 * carries its members' pre-fold keys, and a head that never re-places when a member's
 * marker text or contextual verdict moves is a stale keep-next group.
 *
 * Every kept block prices its own chain ({@link keepNextPlan}), the head when it decides to
 * move and each member when it decides to split early, so each one folds its OWN window:
 * the raw keys of the blocks that pricing can read. A window folded recursively from the
 * successor's key would have to restart somewhere to stay bounded, and a block just past the
 * restart would drop out of the keys of the blocks that still price it. The window matches
 * the lookahead: it spends a slot on each positioned frame, which contributes only a skip
 * marker, ends after the first block that keeps nothing, and stops at the chain cap. A
 * trailing `.` records that the window reached the story's last block, whose position
 * decides whether it ends the chain and whether a section mark keeps its page break.
 *
 * Each key grows by at most {@link MAX_KEEP_NEXT_CHAIN} - 1 unfolded keys, so a document
 * declaring `w:keepNext` on every paragraph costs work linear in its length, and no single
 * key grows with it.

 * TOC field verdicts, the list marker, a page break before the section mark, and
 * `w:keepNext` (§17.3.1.15) — each of which makes a block's placement depend on a block it

 *
 * Each fold returns its input BY IDENTITY when nothing folds, so a document that reads
 * across no boundary at all reaches the end holding the array it started with.
 *
 * `keepNextFlowKeys` runs LAST, and the order is load-bearing. It is the only fold that
 * splices a NEIGHBOUR'S WHOLE KEY into a block's own, so whatever it reads has to be
 * finished: run it first and a chain head carries its members' pre-fold keys, which is a
 * head that never re-places when a member's marker, contextual or border verdict moves.
 * That is latent rather than live today only because `keepNextGroupHeight` prices AUTHORED
 * spacing; folding last makes the composition correct whatever that lookahead grows into.
 * The composition lives HERE, next to the folds, so the order is testable — see
 * `pagination-keeps.test.ts`.
