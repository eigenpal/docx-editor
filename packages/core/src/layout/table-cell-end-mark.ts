/**
 * What a row asks of a `w:vMerge` continuation cell when NOTHING ELSE can size it.
 *
 * A continuation cell is excluded from its row's height, the same way it is excluded from
 * painting: `vmerge-continuation-control.docx` t8 puts a continuation authoring 18pt of
 * `w:after` beside a plain one-line cell, and the reference row is 15.60pt — the plain
 * cell's line, with the continuation's box contributing nothing.
 *
 * A row whose cells are ALL continuations has nothing left to size it, and the reference
 * then sizes it from the END-OF-CELL paragraph's box: spacing before, the mark's line, and
 * spacing after. Same control, same capture, row-2 content between the painted rules:
 *
 *   t1 bare `w:p` inheriting Normal `w:after="120"`   21.60 = 15.60 line + 6
 *   t2 `w:after="0"`                                  15.60 = the line alone
 *   t3 `w:before="240" w:after="360"`                 45.60 = 15.60 + 12 + 18
 *   t4 THREE paragraphs of text, `w:after="0"`        15.36 - the mark, NOT the content
 *   t5 mark at `w:sz="32"`                            22.32 = the 16pt line
 *   t7 two continuation rows                          21.36 and 21.60 - per row, not per span
 *
 * t4 is why this reads the end mark rather than flowing the cell: three paragraphs of text
 * that the cell does not paint measure the same as one empty paragraph.
 *
 * t8 cannot separate "contributes nothing" from "contributes its bare mark line", because
 * there the two are both 15.60. This takes the first reading, which is the one that leaves
 * every mixed row in the corpus where it already is.
 *
 * OPEN: t6 gives a continuation `w:hideMark` and the reference row is 23.52pt, neither zero
 * nor any line this file can derive. `hideMark` keeps its engine-wide meaning here until a
 * control explains that number; no corpus document sets it on a continuation.
