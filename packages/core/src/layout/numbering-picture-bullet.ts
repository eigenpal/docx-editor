// Bounded projection of `w:numPicBullet` (§17.9.20) for list markers that draw an image.
//
// A picture bullet is a VML `w:pict` inside `numbering.xml`: a `v:shape` with an authored
// `style="width:…;height:…"` and a `v:imagedata r:id`. The relationship belongs to the
// NUMBERING part, not the document part, so the resolved id is only meaningful together
// with the part that owns it.
//
// Projection only. Every value here is file-derived: counts are capped, sizes are clamped,
// and a shape this cannot read resolves to "no picture bullet", which leaves the level's
// `w:lvlText` in force rather than failing the document.
