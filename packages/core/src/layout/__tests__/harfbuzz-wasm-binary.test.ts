// The WASM URL escape hatch (#282).
//
// The inlined HarfBuzz runtime locates its binary through
// `resolveHarfBuzzWasmBinaryUrl`, wired in by the build. These tests pin the contract the
// runtime and `setHarfBuzzWasmUrl` share: the override wins, the bundler's URL is the
// fallback, the location is read once, and a call that arrives too late says so instead of
// throwing at a consumer who is following the error's own advice.
