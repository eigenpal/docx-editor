// What convergence does with each field of a FLOW CHECKPOINT.
//
// A resumed pass converges when the in-page flow returns to exactly the state the previous
// pass recorded at the same paragraph (`flowCheckpointsMatch` in `flow-checkpoint.ts`). That
// comparison is explicit: a field captured and restored by `FlowCheckpointOwner` but
// missing from the comparison converges a MISMATCHED flow, and ships the silent failure this
// lane has been bitten by before — `deferredAnchoredDrawings` was exactly that field once
// (see the comment on it in `layout-session.ts`).
//
// This is `PAGE_REUSE_GUARDS` for the checkpoint: the set, written down and type-checked. A
// new `FlowCheckpoint` field is a type error here until somebody says what convergence does
// with it, and the companion test changes every field to verify its declared convergence behavior.
