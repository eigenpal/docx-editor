// that face's ascent and descent move every line and every page break. The authored face's

// glyphs, the way a packaged plan's `lineMetrics` keeps it for its substitute. Widths are not
// recorded: they need the face, and a face that is not metric-compatible would trade one
// error for another. Values are `hhea` ascent, descent and line gap in 2048ths of an em, the
// same for every style of the family. Numbers only; no font data.
