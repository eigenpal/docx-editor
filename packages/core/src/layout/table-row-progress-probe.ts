/**
 * Whether a bounded row placement can consume authored content without publishing anything.
 *
 * Repeated table headers ask this before committing their copy to a continuation page. A header
 * that leaves no room for the pending row must be omitted on that page; discovering that only
 * after placement would leave live line ids, drawing sinks and shared budgets mutated by geometry
 * that is then discarded. The probe deliberately keeps all geometry inputs (including page wrap
 * zones and the exact continuation cursor) while replacing every publication/retention seam.
 *
 * It intentionally probes the row without an admitted vMerge plan. Admission is tied to the
 * row's committed page position and has no snapshot/rollback seam; reusing the previous page's
 * options produced false negatives for carried merges, while accepting against a speculative
 * header position would leave stale floors behind when the repeat is suppressed. The unplanned
 * row is the conservative progress baseline: vMerge can detach or floor geometry, but cannot take
 * away the first authored progress that this baseline can place.
