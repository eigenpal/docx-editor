// What leaves the system: applying a host's export policy to the custom nodes in a document.
//
// A host may not want its own markup travelling in a file its users download — a `w:tag` naming
// the tool, or a payload that means nothing anywhere else. This is the mechanism for that, and
// it takes the DECISION from the caller: core has no idea which tags belong to which definition,
// and a policy guessed from a tag prefix would be this library deciding what a host's nodes mean.
//
// Three fates, and the middle one is the interesting one:
//
//   - `keep`   — untouched, tag, binding, payload and all.
//   - `text`   — the control is UNWRAPPED. A reader still sees the words; the `w:sdt`, its tag,
//                its binding and its node are gone. Right for a citation, whose text is the point.
//   - `remove` — the control goes and takes its content with it.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT MAKE ANONYMOUS. It removes THIS LIBRARY'S markup and nothing else. A `.docx`
// carries its origin in `docProps/app.xml`, `docProps/core.xml`, comment and revision authors,
// rsids and custom document properties. Describing this as "no traces" would be false, and the
// distinction belongs here as much as in the docs.
