// Drawing renderers that a capability package installs: a chart reader, the SmartArt layout
// engine for a diagram saved without its drawing part, shape effects beyond the outer shadow,
// VML text art outside a watermark, and the EMF/WMF metafile replay and rasterizer.
//
// The engine reads a saved SmartArt drawing, shapes, groups, canvases and pictures on its own.
// A chart, or a diagram it would have to lay out, keeps its labelled placeholder until a
// renderer for it is installed. A shape paints without the effects no renderer projects, a
// text path outside a watermark keeps the placeholder of a refused legacy drawing, and a
// metafile picture keeps the placeholder of an image format the engine cannot decode.
//
// The boundary is the projection: the engine paints whatever a projection carries, and a
// renderer decides whether the projection carries it. Installation is process-wide, because
// drawing projections are shared by every editor and export that reads the same parsed
// package; install renderers before any document opens. Looking up a renderer is one property
// read, so documents without these drawings pay nothing for the hooks.
