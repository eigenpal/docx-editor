// The customXml DATA PART: a package-level XML store a document carries alongside its body,
// and the only place a payload too large for `w:tag` can live and still survive Word.
//
// WHY THIS SHAPE
//
// A run-level SDT anchors a host's node in the body, but `w:tag` caps at 64 characters, so
// anything larger needs somewhere else to sit. OOXML's answer is a custom XML data part:
// `/customXml/itemN.xml` holding the payload, `/customXml/itemPropsN.xml` giving it a
// `ds:itemID` GUID, and a `customXml` relationship from the story that owns it. An SDT binds
// to a node inside it through `w:dataBinding` (`@w:storeItemID` = that GUID, `@w:xpath` =
// the node), which is the one link Word itself maintains.
//
// The inline `w:customXml` ELEMENT is a different thing and is not what this writes: Word for
// the web refuses a document containing one outright. The data PART is what survives.
//
// The evidence is two fixtures. `sdt-custom-tag-word-roundtrip.docx` is Word's own output for
// a document carrying a store: parts, relationships and payload all came back intact, so Word
// emits and accepts this wiring. It carries no binding.
//
// `sdt-custom-node-databinding-word-roundtrip.docx` is what Word returned for a document that
// DOES carry one, and it settles the rest:
//
//   - `w:dataBinding` survives, with its `prefixMappings`, `storeItemID` and `xpath` intact;
//   - the payload in the store survives unchanged;
//   - `ds:itemID` still matches `w:storeItemID`;
//   - the child order below is right — Word refuses a document whose `sdtPr` children are out
//     of sequence, so a file that comes back at all had them in order;
//   - a bound control with no type child is READ-ONLY in Word. The text is painted from the
//     xpath and a user cannot type into it, which is why the store is the source of truth and
//     the two can never drift. Making one editable in Word means adding `<w:text/>` to turn
//     Word's binding two-way, which is an opt-in, not the default.
//
// One normalization to expect: Word drops `xml:space="preserve"` from the bound run when the
// text has no leading or trailing space, so a label that needs it must re-assert it.
//
// SECURITY: everything read back out of one of these parts came from a file the sender
// controls. This module writes and locates parts; it does not interpret payloads, and a caller
// that renders one owes it the same sanitizing every other file-derived value gets.
