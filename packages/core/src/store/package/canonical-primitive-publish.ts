// Immediate primitive-journal publication.
//
// A journal's `spliceText` and `spliceChildren` effects carry ABSOLUTE positions, diffed
// against the tree the transaction committed against. Holding one back means it can reach
// shared state that a remote update has already moved. An interior stale offset is still
// inside bounds, so validation admits it: every replica then agrees on text nobody typed, or
// tombstones a node nobody deleted. Deferral traded that for keystroke latency, and the
// latency it bought was measured to be small — see
// `openspec/changes/full-document-yjs-collaboration/local-edit-baseline.md`.
//
// So publication is synchronous. The journal reaches its listener in the same frame as the
// commit, before any transport task can deliver a remote update, and positions always match
// the base state they were diffed against.
//
// The FIFO stays. Order between two journals is load-bearing, and a listener that edits the
// store it is publishing must not have its own journal stranded.
