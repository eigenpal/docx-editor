// Which nodes a whole-subtree memo keeps an entry for.
//
// Subtree memos (`WeakMap<node, answer>`) let an edit reuse every untouched subtree, because
// an edit shares those nodes by reference. Most nodes of a story are leaves or hold only
// leaves: run and paragraph property elements, `w:t`. One entry per such node is most of a
// memo's size, and a major GC visits every entry of every live weak collection.
//
// A node whose children are all leaves is answered again from those children, at most
// `WIDE_SUBTREE_CHILDREN - 1` of them, with no deeper walk. Its parent has a grandchild
// element, so the parent keeps its entry and an untouched subtree still answers in one read.
