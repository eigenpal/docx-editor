// How saved field results are addressed in paragraph offsets.
//
// `atomic` (the default): every closed field is one offset unit, whatever its result. This is
// the raw paragraph text that `paragraphTextOf`, collaboration, and the automation lane read.
//
// `editable`: a field that shows its SAVED result (DATE, MERGEFIELD, HYPERLINK display text,
// see `fieldResultAddressing`) addresses its result runs as ordinary text, and its markers and
// instruction take no offsets. Fields painted from a live value stay one unit.
//
// The mode is passed explicitly at every public boundary (`EditOptions.fieldResults`,
// `paragraphTextOf(..., { fieldResults })`). Inside one synchronous store call the boundary
// installs it with `withFieldResultsMode`, so the deep offset helpers it reaches read the same
// mode without each signature carrying it. Nothing outside such a call ever sees `editable`:
// store subscribers run in `atomic`.
//
// The editor enters `editable` only when a host asks for it (`fieldResults` on
// `createDocxEditor`), never with a collaboration module, and refuses a request for both
// (`editor/field-results-scope.ts`).
