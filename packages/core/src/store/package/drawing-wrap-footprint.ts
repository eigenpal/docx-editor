// extent, a position and a wrap, and text flows around that area whether or not the graphic
// paints. An inline drawing still takes its extent on its line. The footprint keeps exactly
// those layout facts and removes every paint payload, so layout reserves the space and every
// output sees a hidden record with nothing to draw.
