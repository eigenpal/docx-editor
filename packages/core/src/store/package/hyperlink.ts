// Reading a typed `w:hyperlink` into a target record, and the ONE place a file-derived link
// target becomes a runtime URL.
//
// TWO VALUES, NEVER ONE. `authored` is the target exactly as the document wrote it — that is
// what serialization re-emits, XML-escaped, and it is never touched by sanitization, so a
// round trip is lossless whatever the target says. `href` is the runtime projection, produced
// once here through `sanitizeHref`, and it is the only value allowed to reach a DOM
// attribute, `window.open`, or the clipboard. A refused scheme (`javascript:`, `data:`,
// `vbscript:`, `file:`) yields `href: null` — an INERT link: it still paints, still holds its
// text, still saves, and has no way to be activated.
//
// Sanitizing here rather than at each consumer is the whole point. Paint, the popover,
// navigation and the editor query are four sinks; a boundary crossed once cannot be crossed
// inconsistently, and a new consumer inherits the guarantee instead of having to remember it.
//
// NOTHING IN THIS MODULE FETCHES. Resolving a relationship means reading the package's own
// rels record; an external target is classified and validated as a string and never
// requested. Opening a document performs no network access for any hyperlink.
