// Actor-scoped decimal id allocation for revision, comment, relationship, bookmark,
// `_Toc` bookmark-name, content-control, and numbering id namespaces.
//
// WHY STRIPES: two replicas that mint by "one past the highest local id" compute the SAME
// value from the same snapshot. The CRDT then keeps both nodes and the shared `@w:id` /
// `rIdN`, so Accept on your tracked change accepts a colleague's edit, and comment anchors
// cross-link. The collision is not structural — the tree is fine, the id namespace is not.
//
// A residue class per actor (id ≡ stripe (mod N)) makes concurrent mints land on disjoint
// numbers, so they cannot meet. N stays small so collaborative ids stay near Word's dense
// range rather than jumping to `rId1048577`. Solo documents pass no actor and keep Word's
// "one past highest" sequence byte-for-byte.
//
// The actor is the SAME `TransactOptions.actorId` the surface already hands the store when a
// collaboration session is attached. This module does not invent a second identity.

/**
 * Stripe count.
 *
 * Two actors that hash into one residue class walk the identical sequence over the identical
 * used-set and mint the identical id — the collision this whole module exists to prevent. So
 * the count is a birthday problem in disguise, not a cosmetic choice: with 16 classes a
 * five-person room shares a stripe 50% of the time (measured over 20,000 sampled rooms, actor
 * ids in the `name:uuid` shape hosts actually produce). This was 16, and it made the striping
 * roughly a coin flip.
 *
 * 65,536 takes that to 0.02% for five and about 0.3% for twenty. The cost is only that a
 * collaborative document's first ids read `rId5095` rather than `rId3`; ids are opaque, and
 * every namespace here has a ceiling in the billions. A solo document passes no actor and keeps
 * Word's dense sequence byte-for-byte, so nothing a single author saves is affected.
 *
 * The hash is FNV-1a, the same one paragraph ids use, so the mapping is stable across
 * processes. Its low bits are uniform enough for a power-of-two modulus: chi-square over 256
 * bins of 200,000 samples came back 257 against an expected 256.
 *
 * A collision remains POSSIBLE, and nothing detects one after the fact. That repair is
 * deferred by design (D4); this constant only makes reaching it unlikely.
