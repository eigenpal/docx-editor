// Whose words are these — the two questions a tracked deletion asks (tracked-edits seam).
//
// `applyDeleteTracked` does one of two different things to the characters it covers, and the
// answer turns on the run's ancestry alone: a run already inside a `w:del` is left as it is,
// a run inside the author's OWN `w:ins` is RETRACTED (it leaves the paragraph, because those
// words were never anyone else's to see), and everything else is STRUCK in place.
//
// The predicates live here rather than in the writer because a CALLER has to be able to ask
// the same question before it builds a plan. Striking keeps offsets; retracting moves every
// offset past it to the left. A replacement aimed past a selection that turns out to be
// retracted is aimed past the end of the paragraph, which the store refuses — and a refusal
// takes the whole transaction, so the keystroke does nothing at all.
