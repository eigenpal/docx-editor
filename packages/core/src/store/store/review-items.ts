// The review-item VOCABULARY and its pure helpers: the typed item shapes, stable keys, and
// position resolution over the paragraph order.
//
// It lives in the STORE lane because every lane has to speak it. The queue derivation
// (`review-reads.ts`) builds these items from the tree; the binding lane patches a cached
// queue locally after a keystroke; the layout lane resolves card geometry over layout
// records; the editor surfaces activate and cycle them. Binding and layout may not import
// each other, and the store is the one lane both may import — a vocabulary declared in
// either of them forces the other to copy it, and two copies of a reviewer's queue shapes
// drift eventually.
//
// Everything here is pure over the types; none of it can produce a queue, measure a line,
// or touch a part. Deriving items is `review-reads.ts` (and, for custom cards, the pro
// review module); geometry over layout records is `layout/review-support.ts`.
