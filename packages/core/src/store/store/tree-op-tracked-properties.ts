// Tracked FORMAT changes — `w:rPrChange` and `w:pPrChange` (tracked-edits seam).
//
// The third kind of tracked edit, beside content wrappers (`tree-op-tracked.ts`) and
// paragraph marks (`tree-op-tracked-marks.ts`). Content revisions keep the CHARACTERS and say
// who added or struck them; this one keeps the characters exactly as they were and says what
// their PROPERTIES used to be.
//
// The shape is the same for all three containers: the container keeps its new children, and
// gains one change wrapper holding a copy of the container as it was.
//
//   w:rPr        → w:rPrChange/w:rPr   (CT_RPrChange over CT_RPrOriginal,      §17.13.5.30)
//   w:pPr/w:rPr  → w:rPrChange/w:rPr   (CT_ParaRPrChange over CT_ParaRPrOriginal, §17.13.5.31)
//   w:pPr        → w:pPrChange/w:pPr   (CT_PPrChange over CT_PPrBase,           §17.13.5.29)
//
// TWO RULES DO ALL THE WORK.
//
// THE RECORD IS THE ORIGINAL, NOT THE PREVIOUS STATE. Only one change wrapper may sit in a
// container, so a second format press over an already-pending change cannot record a second
// step. It keeps the record that is already there — the state Reject has to restore — and
// only re-attributes it. Recording the intermediate state instead would make Reject restore
// a document nobody ever saw.
//
// A WRITE THAT ARRIVES BACK AT THE ORIGINAL LEAVES NO RECORD. Setting a colour and then
// setting it back is not two proposals, and a card offering to revert a change that no longer
// exists is worse than no card: accepting and rejecting it both produce the same document, so
// the reviewer cannot tell what they decided. Same rule `retractsOwnParagraphMark` applies to
// a break the author took back.
//
// "The original" means the PROPERTY SET, compared as elements, and that is the whole of what
// this module can know. A TOGGLE pressed twice does not reach it: toggling off writes an
// explicit `<w:b w:val="0"/>` rather than dropping `w:b`, because the property may come from a
// style and dropping the override would let it back (see `toggleRunProperty`). Whether that
// explicit off is a real change is a question about the CASCADE, and the store lane has none
// by design — reading one here would be the same mistake as merging a write against a cascaded
// bag. So Bold on then Bold off records a change, exactly as it writes one.
//
// `resolveRevisions` already resolves both wrappers — accept drops the record, reject
// restores what it holds. This module is the missing WRITE half.
