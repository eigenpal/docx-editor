/**
 * Fold chains of ADJACENT items of one kind by one author into single cards.
 *
 * A word struck in several gestures — or re-struck around something a `w:del` cannot
 * contain — lands in the file as several sibling elements under distinct ids. They are one
 * decision to the reviewer. Adjacency uses the same exact
 * end-to-start test, so an untracked character between two
 * deletions keeps them apart.
 *
 * ZERO-WIDTH members are why this is a sweep rather than a lookup keyed by start position.
 * Tracking the removal of a field wraps each `w:fldChar` and each `w:instrText` run in a
 * `w:del` of its own, so a struck form field arrives as several revisions that cover no
 * characters and share one offset with the struck text beside them. They are not separate
 * decisions. A map from start position to item can hold
 * only one of them, which stranded every other one as a blank `Deleted` card. A member
 * covering no characters therefore joins the chain WITHOUT moving its frontier: the
 * revision it sits against still begins where the wrapper does.
