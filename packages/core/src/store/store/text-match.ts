// query is host input, a haystack is file content, and both are bounded HERE rather than at
// each caller's discretion.
//
// NO REGEX ON EITHER SIDE. The needle and the haystack are attacker-influenced, so a pattern
// built from either is a catastrophic-backtracking hazard. Scanning is `indexOf` only; the one
// regex in this module runs against a SINGLE character at a time for the whole-word test,
