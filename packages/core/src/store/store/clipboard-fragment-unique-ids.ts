// The document-unique id namespaces ONE clipboard paste has to freshen: bookmark `@w:id`,
// revision `@w:id`, and `wp:docPr/@id`.
//
// Split out of `clipboard-fragment-merge.ts` (max-lines cap) when the three counters stopped
// being `++` walks. Each one seeded from "one past the highest in the target" and then counted
// up. That is Word's own sequence and exactly what two replicas compute identically from one
// snapshot: both peers paste the same picture and both call it `wp:docPr/@id="6"`. The tree
// converges, so nothing reports it — only the id namespace is wrong, and only the merged
// document shows it. Word treats a `docPr` id as document-global and renumbers on open, a
// shared bookmark id makes one hyperlink resolve to the other peer's marker, and a shared
// revision id makes Accept on your insertion accept theirs.
//
// With a collaboration actor bound, every id here comes from that actor's residue class
// (`id % ACTOR_ID_STRIPE === actorStripe(actor)`), so no other actor's stripe can contain it.
// Striping only the SEED is not enough and is worse than nothing: seed in the stripe, then
// `++`, and the second id has already left it while the code reads as striped. With no actor
// bound — a solo author, Word's case — every family keeps its dense `seed, seed + 1, …` walk
// byte for byte, because a file nobody is collaborating on is the fidelity baseline.
