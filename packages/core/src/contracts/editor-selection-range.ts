/**
 * The current text selection as two paragraph positions.
 *
 * It is a valid `range` for `exec({ type: 'setSelection', range })`, so a read can be passed
 * back unchanged to restore the selection. Passing it back opens the story it is in, such as
 * a header, a note, or a text box. `paragraphId` is the id that `TextMatch.blockId`,
 * `HighlightRange.blockId`, and `ParagraphSummary.id` carry. `offset` counts UTF-16 code
 * units in the paragraph's model text, in the units of `TextMatch.start`,
 * `HighlightRange.start`, and `ParagraphSummary.text`. A field counts the way those count it.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const range = editor.getSelectionRange();
 * if (range) {
 *   // ... the user works elsewhere ...
 *   editor.exec({ type: 'setSelection', range });
 * }
 * ```

   * offsets always describe the current text.
