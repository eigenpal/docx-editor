// into the document, never shared with other participants, and never read by an exporter.
// That is why they live here and not in `RevisionMarkupOptions` (which the exporters read)
// or in `ZoomMode` (which knows nothing about review). The review module supplies the
// initial values, `setReviewPaneOptions` changes them at runtime, and `snapshot.reviewPane` reads
// them, so a toggle in host chrome re-renders like any other control.

 *   `revisionsIn: 'balloons'` the pane lists no tracked change and no reply to one, so
 *   tracked changes and their replies alone do not open it.

 * - `'shrinkPage'`: under a fit zoom mode, the page may shrink down to the mode's
 *   `minZoom` (or 10%) so that the full column fits. The pane changes to the marker strip
 *   only when the column does not fit at that floor either. A fixed zoom behaves as
 *   `'float'`.
 * - `'scroll'`: the page keeps the size it has beside the closed pane's marker strip, and
 *   the full column stands beside it. The document and the column scroll together: the
 *   viewport scrolls sideways to reach the cards.
 *
 * The setting applies to the review pane only. The navigation pane stays docked at its side
 * in every mode: it never scrolls with the document, and it takes its room beside the page
 * exactly as it does with no review pane.
