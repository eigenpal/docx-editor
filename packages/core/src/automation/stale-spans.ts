// Refuse an endpoint whose position moved after the endpoint was read.
//
// Offsets are raw UTF-16 positions in one paragraph. An edit before an offset moves it, so an
// endpoint read before that edit names different text afterwards. Written through, it edits
// whatever now sits at the old offset: the wrong words, silently.
//
// The host stamps every endpoint it answers with the revision it was read at (`readAt`), and
// records the text of the endpoint's paragraph at that revision. An endpoint at offset k read at
// an older revision is still valid while the paragraph's first k characters are unchanged: an
// edit after it, or a formatting edit anywhere, moves nothing. A span's end endpoint covers its
// content in a one-paragraph span. A span's start in an EARLIER paragraph than its end covers
// the rest of that paragraph too, so there the whole paragraph must be unchanged, and so must every
// paragraph between the two endpoints and the list of those paragraphs: a paragraph that another
// writer inserted or removed between them changes what the span covers. A revision the history
// no longer holds cannot be checked, so it is stale too: the caller reads again.
//
// The history is kept per paragraph, not per revision: a paragraph whose text does not change
// keeps one record for as long as it stays unchanged, so a long run of writes elsewhere never
// expires it. Superseded records go first, oldest first, once the total text exceeds a budget.
