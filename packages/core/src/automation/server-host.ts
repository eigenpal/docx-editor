// The headless automation host.
//
// It owns what a browser session owns and nothing more: a package it opened through the
// bounded OPC/XML reader, one `TreePackageStore` over it, and the same `transact` write path
// the editor uses. There is no second model here — the store IS the document, exactly as in
// the browser, which is why the differential tests can compare the two hosts' canonical
// fingerprints rather than just their answers.
//
// UNTRUSTED BYTES. A `.docx` is a zip of XML an attacker controls end to end, so opening one
// goes through `readOoxmlPackage` — decompression-ratio and size caps, part/rel path
// validation, DTD/entity-free XML — and a refusal is a typed reason rather than a throw. This
// host performs no external fetch of any kind, and it has no HTML, DOM or CSS sink to feed:
// the only thing that leaves it is DOCX bytes from the normalizing serializer, and plain text
// and opaque handles through the protocol.
//
// PARAGRAPH IDENTITY is normalized at open, the same way the browser session normalizes it,
// so a document Word never gave `w14:paraId`s gets them once and both hosts hold the same
// canonical tree from revision zero. Skipping it here would make the two hosts' fingerprints
// differ on the first save of such a document, for no reason a consumer could see.
