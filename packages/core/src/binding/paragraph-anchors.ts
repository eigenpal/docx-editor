// The paraId ↔ node-id map: where the contract's addressing vocabulary meets the tree's.
//
// The public contract addresses paragraphs by `w14:paraId` (`DocAnchor.paraId` — the
// same handle Office JS exposes as `Paragraph.uniqueLocalId`), while the engine
// addresses them by canonical node id (structural paths, positional). This index is
// the translation, built in one `allParagraphs` walk and memoized per revision by the
// session, the same way `documentOutline` is.
//
// Scope: EVERY story the document holds — the main part, each header and footer, and the note
// parts. It was the main part alone, and the comment here pointed at `DocLocation` as the way
// to reach the rest; `resolveAnchorSelection` refuses `DocLocation` endpoints outright, so no
// addressing form reached a header paragraph at all. `snapshot().selection` was therefore null
// for the whole time the caret was in one, which is an agent unable to see where the user is.
