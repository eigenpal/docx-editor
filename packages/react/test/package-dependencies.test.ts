// How this package asks for the engine, which decides whether a page ends up with one of it.
//
// The engine carries module-level state: the HarfBuzz shaper and its cache budget, the grapheme
// boundary strategy, and layout caches keyed by object identity. Two copies in one tree do not
// crash. They load the shaper twice, read a boundary configured on the other copy, and miss every
// identity-keyed cache — wrong and expensive, quietly.
//
// This is the package that CONSTRUCTS the editor, so it is the one a second copy hurts most, and
// it is the easiest place to acquire one: `@docx-editor.dev/core` is published and documented, so
// a consumer installing it directly is invited, not exotic. A regular dependency lets a package
// manager nest a second copy the moment the ranges diverge — and `workspace:*` publishes as an
// exact pin, so the ranges diverge as soon as the engine ships a version this adapter was not
// built against. A peer makes the manager resolve one, and say so at install when it cannot.
//
// `packages/pro/src/__tests__/package-dependencies.test.ts` asserts the same thing for the module
// package, for the same reason. Neither file is decoration: moving the engine back to a regular
// dependency is the failure both were written to catch.
