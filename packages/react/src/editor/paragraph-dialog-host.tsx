// opening devtools — and a dialog mounted inside it is unmounted with it, mid-edit, with no
// warning and nothing written. The toolbar root does not move, so the dialog lives here and
// the row only asks for it.
//
// The provider also owns handing focus back, because it is the only thing that still exists
// when the dialog closes: the row that opened it may itself have moved into the overflow
// panel by then.
