// Opening a document, as a hook.
//
// Every host was writing the same thirty lines to get one document on screen: fetch the
// bytes, load and install the fonts, compose them into a `FontConfiguration`, keep the two
// from racing, cancel both if the component unmounts or the source changes, and turn a
// failure into something renderable. None of that is about the host's product, and getting
// the cancellation wrong is the kind of bug that only shows up as a React warning in
// somebody else's console.
//
// FONTS ARE PASSED IN, not imported. `@docx-editor.dev/fonts` ships font BYTES; making this
// package depend on it would put megabytes in the bundle of every consumer who brings their
// own faces or wants none. So the hook takes the origins — `{ fonts: packagedFonts() }` for
// Word's defaults — and owns only the wiring around them.
//
// TWO FONT PATHS, and which one a caller is on decides whether the document waits:
//
//   EAGER — a value, a promise, or a zero-argument loader. The answer is complete before
//   the file is parsed, so the bytes are held back until it lands and the document
//   paginates exactly once.
//
//   ON DEMAND — a resolver marked by `defineFontResolver` (`packagedFonts()`,
//   `googleFonts()`). Its answer depends on the families the file declares, which nothing
//   knows until the engine has parsed it. There is nothing to wait FOR, so the bytes go
//   straight through and the engine calls the resolver after the parse.
//
// The two are indistinguishable as types — `() => X` is assignable to `(request) => X` —
// which is why the mark exists and why `isFontResolver`, not arity, is what picks the path.

 * different: there is nothing to show, so it lands on `error`.
 *
 * THE DOCUMENT WAITS FOR THE FONTS, on the eager path. They fetch concurrently, but
 * `document` stays undefined until fonts have settled — resolved OR failed — because layout
 * MEASURES with them. Handing the editor bytes first paginates the whole document on the
 * fixed fallback and then re-paginates when the real faces arrive, which the reader sees as
 * the text jumping. One slightly longer wait beats a visible reflow. Without a `fonts`

 * resolver is answered with the families the file declares, which nothing knows until the
 * engine has parsed it, so holding the bytes back would wait on work that only the bytes
 * can start. `document` is released at once, `fonts` is a stable resolver, and the engine
 * re-paginates when the faces land. That one reflow is what buys loading only the faces the
 * document uses; `{ fonts: defaultFonts }` is still there when the no-reflow guarantee
 * matters more than the megabytes.
 *
 * A URL is fetched with the browser's own `fetch`, exactly as the caller wrote it. Validate
 * it first if it came from user input: this hook adds no allowlist of its own, and inventing
 * one would only give callers a false sense of where the trust boundary is.
