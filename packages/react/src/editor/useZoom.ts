// The zoom lifecycle, as one hook.
//
// Everything here is a thin read of engine state plus a call back into it — there is no zoom
// state in React. That is deliberate: the engine owns the scale because the painted pages,
// the ruler and hit testing all divide by it, and a second copy in a component would be a
// fourth opinion that drifts the first time a fit refits without asking.
//
// Both halves of the state are exposed because neither implies the other. `zoom` is the
// resolved number a ruler multiplies by; `mode` is what a control has to show as selected. A
// menu that ticked the entry matching the percentage would tick "75%" while the editor was
// tracking the viewport and about to move off it.
