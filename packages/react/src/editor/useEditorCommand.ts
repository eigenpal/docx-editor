// One editor control, as a hook.
//
// Takes EITHER a chrome slot or a raw `EditorCommand`. The slot form derives the
// enabled/active triple through `toolbarCommandState` — the shared can-before-exec table
// both adapters use — so a registry control cannot describe itself differently in two
// places. The command form asks `Editor.can`/`isActive` about the command directly.
//
// BOTH forms exist because the registry is not the whole vocabulary. It describes toolbar
// and menu-bar controls; commands like `cut`, `selectAll` or a host's own `setMarkAttr`
// action have no slot and never will, and before this took them every such control
// hand-rolled its own copy of this derivation.
//
// Either way the component re-renders only when its OWN answer moves: the slice is
// compared field-wise, so a bold button sleeps through caret moves that change nothing
// about bold.
