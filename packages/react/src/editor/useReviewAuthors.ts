// configured up front — it has to read who is actually in the document. This hook is that
// read, reactive: a document load, an edit that introduces a reviewer, and a
// `setRevisionStyles` call all re-render the consumer.

/**
 * Every author the review surface DRAWS, in Word's slot order, with the colour and style
 * each resolves to. `[]` before an editor or document exists.
 *
 * Both halves of review: authors of tracked changes first, numbered by where their first
 * change appears, then authors who only commented. One person is one colour across the two.
 *
 * A read of the rendered projection, not of the package: a resolved view hides the
 * revisions it has resolved away, so an author whose only change is hidden there is listed
 * only if they also commented.
 *
 * The array is reference-stable between changes (the facade caches per layout and colour
 * state), so it is safe as a dependency and under `useSyncExternalStore`.
 *
 * Pairs with the declarative components: read the roster here, declare the styling as
 * `<DocxEditor.AuthorStyle>` elements.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const authors = useReviewAuthors();
 * authors.map(({ author }) => (
 *   <DocxEditor.AuthorStyle key={author} author={author} color={myTeam[author]?.color} />
 * ));
 * ```
