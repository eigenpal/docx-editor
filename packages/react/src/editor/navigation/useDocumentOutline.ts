// The headings half of the navigation pane, UI-free.
//
// Headings come from `Editor.getOutline()` — the session's per-revision derivation over
// the canonical trees — re-read on the version-cached snapshot's identity, the same
// subscription pattern as `useFontFamily` and the ruler parts. So the list follows edits
// (retitling a heading, adding one, deleting one) without a bespoke channel.
//
// A jump both MOVES THE CARET and BRINGS THE HEADING INTO VIEW. The two are separate
// because moving the caret does not move the viewport: a heading twenty pages down was
// otherwise selected where nobody could see it. The reveal resolves through layout rather
// than the DOM, so it works for a page that has not been materialised yet — which is
// exactly the page an outline jump asks for.
