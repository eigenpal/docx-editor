// The widest laid-out page, which is the width of the page stack the navigation pane must
// clear. Both adapters carry an identical copy of this file.
//
// WHY NOT THE CARET'S PAGE SETUP. Every page starts at the stack's left edge and the stack is
// as wide as its widest page, so a portrait caret in a document with a landscape section
// measured the stack too narrow and let the pane cover the wider pages.
//
// WHEN IT IS READ. `getPageGeometry()` flushes any pending layout commit, so it is not read
// on every tick, and never on a plain text edit. It is read once when the pane opens, then
// once per settled burst of triggers: page-count steps and caret page-width changes (the
// caller nudges on those), and document changes that add or remove blocks or replace the
// document, which is how a section break with another page size arrives. A burst settles
// after `WIDEST_PAGE_SETTLE_MS` without a new trigger.
