// The find half of the navigation pane, UI-free.
//
// A thin binding over the editor's shared search session (`createDocumentSearch`). Every
// `useDocumentSearch` call and the packaged Find pane read and drive the same session, so a
// host that calls `find()` updates the open pane, and the pane's arrows move the match the
// host reads. Finding is a read and selecting is a write: typing never moves the caret.
//
// TYPING IS DEBOUNCED, RESULTS ARE NOT. `setQuery` waits one debounce; `find` runs now. Once
// a query has run, its results follow the document under it.
//
// MATCHES ARE MARKED IN THE DOCUMENT while a consumer asks for it. The `highlight` option is
// that request; the pane asks only while its Find tab is open.
