/**
 * The imperative `DocxEditorRef` handle: the greenfield seven-member shape, each member
 * forwarding to the `Editor` facade.
 *
 * Every member is safe to call before the editor has mounted. Mutations no-op, and reads
 * return the honest empty answer — `null`, a `notFound` refusal, a loading snapshot —
 * rather than throwing, so a host can hold the ref from first render without guarding it.
 *
 * The legacy nineteen-member handle (zoom, paging, print, find, comments, tracked
 * changes) is gone: everything it mirrored is reachable through the facade via
 * `getEditor`, and mirroring contract capabilities onto the ref is how the two adapters
 * drifted apart.
