// A React host for the engine-owned paginated surface (task 11.1).
//
// THIN, deliberately. The host owns three things and nothing else: a container element, the
// surface's lifetime, and the translation of engine state into React state. Every editing
// decision — what a key does, where the caret goes, what a selection means — belongs to the
// engine, so that React and Vue cannot drift into two behaviours.
//
// The measurer is injected rather than chosen here: which font bytes a document is measured
// and painted with is a packaging decision, and baking one in would make the adapter the
// place fidelity is decided.
//
// The engine is reached through its COMPOSITION ROOT only. An adapter that imported the
// layout lane for a parameter type would be reaching past the boundary for a name, which is
// how a boundary starts leaking. The import path becomes `@docx-editor.dev/core/editor` when
// task 10.5 migrates the namespace.
